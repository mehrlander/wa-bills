## 📊 Query Examples

### Using Lodash (included in demo)

```javascript
// Find all projects for an agency
const projects = _.filter(data.projects, { agencyCode: '103' });

// Get projects over $10M
const largeProjects = _.filter(data.appropriations,
  a => a.type === 'appropriation' && a.amount > 10000000
);

// Group grants by program
const grantsByProgram = _.groupBy(data.grants, 'program');

// Search for housing projects
const housing = _.filter(data.projects,
  p => p.name.toLowerCase().includes('housing')
);

// Top agencies by funding
const topAgencies = _.chain(data.fiscalSummary.byAgency)
  .toPairs()
  .orderBy([1, 'total'], ['desc'])
  .take(10)
  .value();
```

See **SCHEMA.md** for 20+ additional query examples.
