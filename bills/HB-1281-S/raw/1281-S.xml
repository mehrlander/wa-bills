Each employee of the state or its political subdivisions may select the day on which the employee desires to take the additional holiday provided for in this section after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority.</P>

<AnnNote><NoteP><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Findings<TextRun fontFamily="Times New Roman">—</TextRun>2023 c 181:</TextRun> "The legislature finds that drowning is the leading cause of death for children aged one to four, and for every death, there are five to 10 nonfatal cases requiring hospital care. Babies under one year of age are more likely to drown at home, and 23 percent of child drownings occur during a family gathering near a pool.</NoteP><NoteP>The legislature finds that most of these deaths are completely preventable through education around water safety and drowning prevention and increasing equitable access to swimming lessons and water safety tools and equipment. The victims of childhood drowning are disproportionately from communities of color. Forty-five percent of Hispanic children and 64 percent of African American children have limited or no ability to swim, compared to 40 percent of Caucasian children. African American children ages five through 19 are specifically five and one-half times more likely to drown in a swimming pool compared to their Caucasian counterparts. In addition, male children are twice as likely to drown. Socioeconomic factors also have an impact on disproportionate outcomes. Children whose parents are unable to swim often lack the skill as well, and 79 percent of children in households with an income under $50,000 have limited or no ability to swim.</NoteP><NoteP>The legislature emphasizes the importance of educating children, parents, and other caregivers about the basics of swimming, floating, signs of drowning, and how to help drowning victims, as well as bringing awareness to critical layers of protection such as barriers and water safety tools and equipment.

About one in seven people entering a hospital need blood. Blood is always needed for treatment of accident victims, cancer patients, hemophiliacs, and surgery patients. Blood cannot be manufactured. Blood is collected at local donor centers and mobile units travel to hundreds of blood drives every month at work sites, schools, places of worship, and other community locations throughout the Pacific Northwest. Blood donation is one of the most significant contributions that a person can make towards our society. When the Amtrak Cascades passenger train 501 tragically derailed near Olympia on December 18, 2017, our state came together to save the lives of more than eighty injured passengers. A team comprised of emergency responders, health care providers, ordinary citizens, and blood donors at blood centers throughout the state collected over two thousand units to respond to the lives of those in need.

Any selection made as provided shall be prima facie evidence (a) that the property so selected is exempt from execution and attachment, and (b) that the property so selected is not in excess of the values specified for the exemptions.</P>
<P>(3)(a) A debtor who claims personal property as exempt against execution or attachment shall, at any time before sale, deliver to the officer making the levy a list by separate items of the property claimed as exempt, together with an itemized list of all the personal property owned or claimed by the debtor, including money, bonds, bills, notes, claims and demands, with the residence of the person indebted upon the said bonds, bills, notes, claims and demands, and shall verify such list by affidavit.

<P>(b) A creditor, or the agent or attorney of the creditor, who wishes to object to a claim of exemption made to a levying officer, on the ground that the property claimed exceeds exemptible value, may demand appraisement. If the creditor, or the agent or attorney of the creditor, demands an appraisement, two disinterested persons shall be chosen to appraise the property, one by the debtor and the other by the creditor, agent or attorney, and these two, if they cannot agree, shall select a third; but if either party fails to choose an appraiser, or the two fail to select a third, or if one or more of the appraisers fail to act, the court shall appoint one or more as the circumstances require. The appraisers shall forthwith proceed to make a list by separate items, of the personal property selected by the debtor as exempt, which they shall decide as exempt, stating the value of each article, and annexing to the list their affidavit to the following effect: "We solemnly swear that to the best of our judgment the above is a fair cash valuation of the property therein described," which affidavit shall be signed by two appraisers at least, and be certified by the officer administering the oaths. The list shall be delivered to the officer holding the execution or attachment and be annexed to and made part of the return, and the property therein specified shall be exempt from levy and sale, but the other personal estate of the debtor shall remain subject to execution, attachment, or garnishment. Each appraiser shall be entitled to fifteen dollars or such larger fee as shall be fixed by the court, to be paid by the creditor if all the property claimed by the debtor shall be exempt; otherwise to be paid by the debtor.</P>
<P>(c) If, within seven days following the giving of notice to a creditor of an exemption claim, the officer has received no notice from the creditor of an objection to the claim or a demand for appraisement, the officer shall release the claimed property to the debtor.</P>

<P>(1) "Community placement" means that period during which the offender is subject to the conditions of community custody and/or postrelease supervision, which begins either upon completion of the term of confinement (postrelease supervision) or at such time as the offender is transferred to community custody in lieu of earned release. Community placement may consist of entirely community custody, entirely postrelease supervision, or a combination of the two.</P>
<P>(2) "Community supervision" means a period of time during which a convicted offender is subject to crime<Hyphen type="nobreak" />related prohibitions and other sentence conditions imposed by a court pursuant to this chapter or RCW 16.52.200<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">(6)</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">(9)</TextRun> or 46.61.524. Where the court finds that any offender has a chemical dependency that has contributed to his or her offense, the conditions of supervision may, subject to available resources, include treatment. For purposes of the interstate compact for out<Hyphen type="nobreak" />of<Hyphen type="nobreak" />state supervision of parolees and probationers, RCW 9.95.270, community supervision is the functional equivalent of probation and should be considered the same as probation by other states.</P>
<P>(3) "Postrelease supervision" is that portion of an offender's community placement that is not community custody.</P>

<P>(1) No special declarant right, as described in RCW 64.34.020<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">(29)</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">(40)</TextRun>, created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred except by an instrument evidencing the transfer executed by the declarant or the declarant's successor and the transferee is recorded in every county in which any portion of the condominium is located. Each unit owner shall receive a copy of the recorded instrument, but the failure to furnish the copy shall not invalidate the transfer.</P>
<P>(2) Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:</P>
<P>(a) A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon the transferor by this chapter. Lack of privity does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor.</P>
<P>(b) If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant as described in RCW 64.34.020(1), the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of the successor relating to the condominium.</P>
<P>(c) If a transferor retains any special declarant right, but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights arising after the transfer.</P>
<P>(d) A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.</P>
<P>(3) In case of foreclosure of a mortgage, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings of any unit owned by a declarant or real property in a condominium subject to development rights, a person acquiring title to all the real property being foreclosed or sold succeeds to all special declarant rights related to that real property held by that declarant and to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to RCW 64.34.256 and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices, and signs, unless such person requests that all or any of such rights not be transferred. The instrument conveying title shall describe any special declarant rights not being transferred.</P>
<P>(4) Upon foreclosure of a mortgage, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under bankruptcy code or receivership proceedings of all units and other real property in a condominium owned by a declarant:</P>
<P>(a) The declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights; and</P>
<P>(b) The period of declarant control as described in RCW 64.34.308<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">(4)</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">(5)</TextRun> terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant.</P>

<P>(a) A successor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration;</P>
<P>(b) A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in (c) or (d) of this subsection, who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration:</P>
<P>(i) On a declarant which relate to such successor's exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights; or</P>
<P>(ii) On the declarant's transferor, other than:</P>
<P>(A) Misrepresentations by any previous declarant;</P>
<P>(B) Warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant or made before the condominium was created;</P>
<P>(C) Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or the declarant's appointees to the board of directors; or</P>
<P>(D) Any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferor's acts or omissions after the transfer;</P>
<P>(c) A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs as described in RCW 64.34.256, if the successor is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exercise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability arising as a result thereof;</P>
<P>(d) A successor to all special declarant rights held by the successor's transferor who is not an affiliate of that declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a foreclosure, a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or a judgment or instrument conveying title to units under subsection (3) of this section may declare his or her intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by the successor's transferor to control the board of directors in accordance with the provisions of RCW 64.34.308<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">(4)</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">(5)</TextRun> for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void.

<P>(b) In the department's discretion, conduct a public hearing during the thirty-day comment period in the jurisdiction proposing the master program or amendment;</P>
<P>(c) Within fifteen days after the close of public comment, request the local government to review the issues identified by the public, interested parties, groups, and agencies and provide a written response as to how the proposal addresses the identified issues;</P>
<P>(d) Within thirty days after receipt of the local government response pursuant to (c) of this subsection, make written findings and conclusions regarding the consistency of the proposal with the policy of RCW 90.58.020 and the applicable guidelines, provide a response to the issues identified in (c) of this subsection, and either approve the proposal as submitted, recommend specific changes necessary to make the proposal approvable, or deny approval of the proposal in those instances where no alteration of the proposal appears likely to be consistent with the policy of RCW 90.58.020 and the applicable guidelines. The written findings and conclusions shall be provided to the local government, and made available to all interested persons, parties, groups, and agencies of record on the proposal;</P>
<P>(e) If the department recommends changes to the proposed master program or amendment, within thirty days after the department mails the written findings and conclusions to the local government, the local government may:</P>
<P>(i) Agree to the proposed changes by written notice to the department; or</P>
<P>(ii) Submit an alternative proposal. If, in the opinion of the department, the alternative is consistent with the purpose and intent of the changes originally submitted by the department and with this chapter it shall approve the changes and provide notice to all recipients of the written findings and conclusions. If the department determines the proposal is not consistent with the purpose and intent of the changes proposed by the department, the department may resubmit the proposal for public and agency review pursuant to this section or reject the proposal.</P>
<P>(3) The department shall approve the segment of a master program relating to shorelines unless it determines that the submitted segments are not consistent with the policy of RCW 90.58.020 and the applicable guidelines.</P>
<P>(4) The department shall approve the segment of a master program relating to critical areas as defined by RCW 36.70A.030<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">(5)</TextRun> provided the master program segment is consistent with RCW 90.58.020 and applicable shoreline guidelines, and if the segment provides a level of protection of critical areas at least equal to that provided by the local government's critical areas ordinances adopted and thereafter amended pursuant to RCW 36.70A.060(2).</P>
<P>(5) The department shall approve those segments of the master program relating to shorelines of statewide significance only after determining the program provides the optimum implementation of the policy of this chapter to satisfy the statewide interest. If the department does not approve a segment of a local government master program relating to a shoreline of statewide significance, the department may develop and by rule adopt an alternative to the local government's proposal.</P>
<P>(6) In the event a local government has not complied with the requirements of RCW 90.58.070 it may thereafter upon written notice to the department elect to adopt a master program for the shorelines within its jurisdiction, in which event it shall comply with the provisions established by this chapter for the adoption of a master program for such shorelines.</P>
<P>Upon approval of such master program by the department it shall supersede such master program as may have been adopted by the department for such shorelines.</P>
<P>(7) A master program or amendment to a master program takes effect when and in such form as approved or adopted by the department. The effective date is fourteen days from the date of the department's written notice of final action to the local government stating the department has approved or rejected the proposal. For master programs adopted by rule, the effective date is governed by RCW 34.05.380. The department's written notice to the local government must conspicuously and plainly state that it is the department's final decision and that there will be no further modifications to the proposal.</P>

<P>(8) Promptly after approval or disapproval of a local government's shoreline master program or amendment, the department shall publish a notice consistent with RCW 36.70A.290 that the shoreline master program or amendment has been approved or disapproved. This notice must be filed for all shoreline master programs or amendments. If the notice is for a local government that does not plan under RCW 36.70A.040, the department must, on the day the notice is published, notify the legislative authority of the applicable local government by telephone or electronic means, followed by written communication as necessary, to ensure that the local government has received the full written decision of the approval or disapproval.</P>

<P>(1) In lieu of disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 and if the disciplining authority determines that the unprofessional conduct may be the result of an applicable impairing or potentially impairing health condition, the disciplining authority may refer the license holder to a physician health program or a voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program approved by the disciplining authority.</P>
<P>The cost of evaluation and treatment shall be the responsibility of the license holder, but the responsibility does not preclude payment by an employer, existing insurance coverage, or other sources. Evaluation and treatment shall be provided by providers approved by the entity or the commission. The disciplining authority may also approve the use of out-of-state programs. Referral of the license holder to the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program shall be done only with the consent of the license holder. Referral to the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program may also include probationary conditions for a designated period of time. If the license holder does not consent to be referred to the program or does not successfully complete the program, the disciplining authority may take appropriate action under RCW 18.130.160 which includes suspension of the license unless or until the disciplining authority, in consultation with the director of the applicable program, determines the license holder is able to practice safely. The secretary shall adopt uniform rules for the evaluation by the disciplining authority of return to substance use or program violation on the part of a license holder in the program. The evaluation shall encourage program participation with additional conditions, in lieu of disciplinary action, when the disciplining authority determines that the license holder is able to continue to practice with reasonable skill and safety.</P>
<P>(2) In addition to approving the physician health program or the voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program that may receive referrals from the disciplining authority, the disciplining authority may establish by rule requirements for participation of license holders who are not being investigated or monitored by the disciplining authority. License holders voluntarily participating in the approved programs without being referred by the disciplining authority shall not be subject to disciplinary action under RCW 18.130.160 for their impairing or potentially impairing health condition, and shall not have their participation made known to the disciplining authority, if they meet the requirements of this section and the program in which they are participating.</P>
<P>(3) The license holder shall sign a waiver allowing the program to release information to the disciplining authority if the licensee does not comply with the requirements of this section or is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. The physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder program shall report to the disciplining authority any license holder who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or the program or who, in the opinion of the program, is unable to practice with reasonable skill or safety. License holders shall report to the disciplining authority if they fail to comply with this section or do not complete the program's requirements. License holders may, upon the agreement of the program and disciplining authority, reenter the program if they have previously failed to comply with this section.</P>
<P>(4) Program records including, but not limited to, case notes, progress notes, laboratory reports, evaluation and treatment records, electronic and written correspondence within the program, and between the program and the participant or other involved entities including, but not limited to, employers, credentialing bodies, referents, or other collateral sources, relating to license holders referred to or voluntarily participating in approved programs are confidential and exempt from disclosure under chapter 42.56 RCW and shall not be subject to discovery by subpoena or admissible as evidence except:</P>
<P>(a) To defend any civil action by a license holder regarding the restriction or revocation of that individual's clinical or staff privileges, or termination of a license holder's employment. In such an action, the program will, upon subpoena issued by either party to the action, and upon the requesting party seeking a protective order for the requested disclosure, provide to both parties of the action written disclosure that includes the following information:</P>
<P>(i) Verification of a health care professional's participation in the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program as it relates to aspects of program involvement at issue in the civil action;</P>
<P>(ii) The dates of participation;</P>
<P>(iii) Whether or not the program identified an impairing or potentially impairing health condition;</P>
<P>(iv) Whether the health care professional was compliant with the requirements of the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program; and</P>
<P>(v) Whether the health care professional successfully completed the physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program; and</P>
<P>(b) Records provided to the disciplining authority for cause as described in subsection (3) of this section. Program records relating to license holders mandated to the program, through order or by stipulation, by the disciplining authority or relating to license holders reported to the disciplining authority by the program for cause, must be released to the disciplining authority at the request of the disciplining authority. Records held by the disciplining authority under this section are exempt from chapter 42.56 RCW and are not subject to discovery by subpoena except by the license holder.</P>
<P>(5) This section does not affect an employer's right or ability to make employment-related decisions regarding a license holder. This section does not restrict the authority of the disciplining authority to take disciplinary action for any other unprofessional conduct.</P>
<P>(6) A person who, in good faith, reports information or takes action in connection with this section is immune from civil liability for reporting information or taking the action.</P>
<P>(a) The immunity from civil liability provided by this section shall be liberally construed to accomplish the purposes of this section, and applies to both license holders and students and trainees when students and trainees of the applicable professions are served by the program. The persons entitled to immunity shall include:</P>
<P>(i) An approved physician health program or voluntary substance use disorder monitoring program;</P>
<P>(ii) The professional association affiliated with the program;</P>
<P>(iii) Members, employees, or agents of the program or associations;</P>
<P>(iv) Persons reporting a license holder as being possibly impaired or providing information about the license holder's impairment; and</P>
<P>(v) Professionals supervising or monitoring the course of the program participant's treatment or rehabilitation.</P>
<P>(b) The courts are strongly encouraged to impose sanctions on program participants and their attorneys whose allegations under this subsection are not made in good faith and are without either reasonable objective, substantive grounds, or both.</P>
<P>(c) The immunity provided in this section is in addition to any other immunity provided by law.</P>
<P>(7) In the case of a person who is applying to be a substance use disorder professional or substance use disorder professional trainee certified under chapter 18.205 RCW, an agency affiliated counselor <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">credentialed</TextRun> under chapter 18.19 RCW, or a peer specialist or peer specialist trainee certified under chapter 18.420 RCW, if the person is:</P>
<P>(a) Less than one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the duration of time that the person may be required to participate in an approved substance use disorder monitoring program may not exceed the amount of time necessary for the person to achieve one year in recovery; or</P>
<P>(b) At least one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, the person may not be required to participate in the approved substance use disorder monitoring program.</P>
<P>(8) The provisions of subsection (7) of this section apply to any person employed as a peer specialist as of July 1, 2025, participating in a program under this section as of July 1, 2025, and applying to become a certified peer specialist under RCW 18.420.050, regardless of when the person's participation in a program began. To this extent, subsection (7) of this section applies retroactively, but in all other respects it applies prospectively.</P>

<P>(b) The offense was committed as a result of the applicant's substance use or untreated mental health symptoms; and</P>
<P>(c) The applicant is at least one year in recovery from a substance use disorder, whether through abstinence or stability on medication-assisted therapy, or in recovery from a mental health disorder.</P>

<P>(1) The legislature finds that student behavioral health issues have become a crisis in Washington state, necessitating the deployment of behavioral health resources in schools throughout the state. The legislature's concerns are based on the following facts:</P>
<P>(a) According to the healthy youth survey conducted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in 2018, one in five students in eighth, 10th, and 12th grades considered attempting suicide in the past year while just half of those surveyed had an adult to turn to when feeling sad or hopeless;</P>
<P>(b) According to the national institute for mental health, more than one in 25 adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age are experiencing an eating disorder;</P>
<P>(c) According to the national institute of drug abuse, nearly half of 12th grade students have used illicit drugs, six in 10 have drank alcohol, and four in 10 have used <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>;</P>
<P>(d) The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of and exacerbated existing behavioral health disorders for minors across the state; and</P>
<P>(e) A major barrier to behavioral health support for minors is lack of awareness and access to information about existing services.</P>
<P>(2) The legislature intends to require that contact information for a suicide prevention organization, depression or anxiety support organization, eating disorder support organization, substance abuse support organization, and a mental health referral service for children and teens be listed on the home page of each public school website for the following reasons:</P>
<P>(a) Immediate access to behavioral health services often prevents suicide, attempted suicide, and other self-harm; and</P>
<P>(b) Students in public schools often have access to and spend time on the website for their school.</P>

<P>The legislature intends to further the government-to-government relationship between the state of Washington and federally recognized Indian tribes in the state of Washington by authorizing the governor to enter into agreements concerning the regulation of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. Such agreements may include provisions pertaining to: The lawful commercial production, processing, sale, and possession of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for both recreational and medical purposes; <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>-related research activities; law enforcement, both criminal and civil; and taxation. The legislature finds that these agreements will facilitate and promote a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship between the state and the tribes regarding matters relating to the legalization of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, particularly in light of the fact that federal Indian law precludes the state from enforcing its civil regulatory laws in Indian country. Such cooperative agreements will enhance public health and safety, ensure a lawful and well-regulated <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> market, encourage economic development, and provide fiscal benefits to both the tribes and the state.</P>

<P>The legislature finds that since voters approved Initiative Measure No. 692 in 1998, it has been the public policy of the state to permit the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. Between 1998 and the present day, there have been multiple legislative attempts to clarify what is meant by the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> and to ensure qualifying patients have a safe, consistent, and adequate source of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for their medical needs.</P>
<P>The legislature further finds that qualifying patients are people with serious medical conditions and have been responsible for finding their own source of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for their own personal medical use. Either by growing it themselves, designating someone to grow for them, or participating in collective gardens, patients have developed methods of access in spite of continued federal opposition to the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. In a time when access itself was an issue and no safe, consistent source of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> was available, this unregulated system was permitted by the state to ensure some, albeit limited, access to <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for medical use. Also permitted were personal possession limits of fifteen plants and twenty-four ounces of useable <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, which was deemed to be the amount of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> needed for a sixty-day supply. In a time when supply was not consistent, this amount of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> was necessary to ensure patients would be able to address their immediate medical needs.</P>
<P>The legislature further finds that while possession amounts are provided in statute, these do not amount to protection from arrest and prosecution for patients. In fact, patients in compliance with state law are not provided arrest protection. They may be arrested and their only remedy is to assert an affirmative defense at trial that they are in compliance with the law and have a medical need. Too many patients using <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for medical purposes today do not know this; many falsely believe they cannot be arrested so long as their health care provider has authorized them for the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>.</P>
<P>The legislature further finds that in 2012 voters passed Initiative Measure No. 502 which permitted the recreational use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. For the first time in our nation's history, <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> would be regulated, taxed, and sold for recreational consumption. Initiative Measure No. 502 provides for strict regulation on the production, processing, and distribution of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. Under Initiative Measure No. 502, <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> is trackable from seed to sale and may only be sold or grown under license. <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">Marijuana [Cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">Cannabis</TextRun> must be tested for impurities and purchasers of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> must be informed of the THC level in the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. Since its passage, two hundred fifty producer/processor licenses and sixty-three retail licenses have been issued, covering the majority of the state. With the current product canopy exceeding 2.9 million square feet, and retailers in place, the state now has a system of safe, consistent, and adequate access to <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>; the marketplace is not the same marketplace envisioned by the voters in 1998. While medical needs remain, the state is in the untenable position of having a recreational product that is tested and subject to production standards that ensure safe access for recreational users. No such standards exist for medical users and, consequently, the very people originally meant to be helped through the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> do not know if their product has been tested for molds, do not know where their <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> has been grown, have no certainty in the level of THC or CBD in their products, and have no assurances that their products have been handled through quality assurance measures. It is not the public policy of the state to allow qualifying patients to only have access to products that may be endangering their health.</P>
<P>The legislature, therefore, intends to adopt a comprehensive act that uses the regulations in place for the recreational market to provide regulation for the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>. It intends to ensure that patients retain their ability to grow their own <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> for their own medical use and it intends to ensure that patients have the ability to possess more <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>-infused products, useable <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, and <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> concentrates than what is available to a nonmedical user. It further intends that medical specific regulations be adopted as needed and under consultation of the departments of health and agriculture so that safe handling practices will be adopted and so that testing standards for medical products meet or exceed those standards in use in the recreational market.</P>
<P>The legislature further intends that the costs associated with implementing and administering the medical <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> authorization database shall be financed from the health professions account and that these funds shall be restored to the health professions account through future appropriations using funds derived from the dedicated <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> account.</P>

<P>The legislature finds that protecting the state's children, youth, and young adults under the legal age to purchase and consume <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, by establishing limited restrictions on the advertising of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> and <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> products, is necessary to assist the state's efforts to discourage and prevent underage consumption and the potential risks associated with underage consumption. The legislature finds that these restrictions assist the state in maintaining a strong and effective regulatory and enforcement system as specified by the federal government. The legislature finds this act leaves ample opportunities for licensed <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> businesses to market their products to those who are of legal age to purchase them, without infringing on the free speech rights of business owners.

<P>(1)(a) The legislature finds the implementation of Initiative Measure No. 502 has established a clearly disadvantaged regulated legal market with respect to prices and the ability to compete with the unregulated medical dispensary market and the illicit market. The legislature further finds that it is crucial that the state continues to ensure a safe, highly regulated system in Washington that protects valuable state revenues while continuing efforts towards disbanding the unregulated <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> markets. The legislature further finds that ongoing evaluation on the impact of meaningful <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> tax reform for the purpose of stabilizing revenues is crucial to the overall effort of protecting the citizens and resources of this state. The legislature further finds that a partnership with local jurisdictions in this effort is imperative to the success of the legislature's policy objective. The legislature further finds that sharing revenues to promote a successful partnership in achieving the legislature's intent should be transparent and hold local jurisdictions accountable for their use of state shared revenues. Therefore, the legislature intends to reform the current tax structure for the regulated legal <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> system to create price parity with the large medical and illicit markets with the specific objective of increasing the market share of the legal and highly regulated <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> market. The legislature further intends to share <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> tax revenues with local jurisdictions for public safety purposes and to facilitate the ongoing process of ensuring a safe regulated <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> market in all communities across the state.</P>
<P>(b) The legislature further finds <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> use for qualifying patients is a valid and necessary option health care professionals may recommend for their patients. The legislature further finds that while recognizing the difference between recreational and medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, it is also imperative to distinguish that the authorization for medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> is different from a valid prescription provided by a doctor to a patient. The legislature further finds the authorization for medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> is unlike over-the-counter medications that require no oversight by a health care professional. The legislature further finds that due to the unique characterization of authorizations for the medical use of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun>, the policy of providing a tax preference benefit for patients using an authorization should in no way be construed as precedent for changes in the treatment of prescription medications or over-the-counter medications. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide qualifying patients and their designated providers a retail sales and use tax exemption on <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> purchased or obtained for medical use when authorized by a health care professional.</P>
<P>(2)(a) This subsection is the tax preference performance statement for the retail sales and use tax exemption for <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> purchased or obtained by qualifying patients or their designated providers provided in RCW 82.08.9998(1) and 82.12.9998(1). The performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</P>
<P>(b) The legislature categorizes the tax preference as one intended to accomplish the general purposes indicated in RCW 82.32.808(2)(e).</P>
<P>(c) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide qualifying patients and their designated providers a retail sales and use tax exemption on <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> purchased or obtained for medical use when authorized by a health care professional.</P>
<P>(d) To measure the effectiveness of the exemption provided in chapter 4, Laws of 2015 2nd sp. sess. in achieving the specific public policy objective described in (c) of this subsection, the department of revenue must provide the necessary data and assistance to the state liquor and cannabis board for the report required in RCW 69.50.535.</P>

<P>(1) The legislature finds that additional efforts are necessary to reduce barriers to entry to the cannabis industry for individuals and communities most adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws. In the interest of establishing a cannabis industry that is equitable and accessible to those most adversely impacted by the enforcement of drug-related laws, including cannabis-related laws, the legislature finds a social equity program should be created.</P>
<P>(2) The legislature finds that individuals who have been arrested or incarcerated due to drug laws, and those who have resided in areas of high poverty, suffer long-lasting adverse consequences, including impacts to employment, business ownership, housing, health, and long-term financial well-being. The legislature also finds that family members, especially children, and communities of those who have been arrested or incarcerated due to drug laws, suffer from emotional, psychological, and financial harms as a result of such arrests and incarceration. The legislature further finds that individuals in disproportionately impacted areas suffered the harms of enforcement of cannabis-related laws. Those communities face greater difficulties accessing traditional banking systems and capital for establishing businesses.</P>
<P>(3) The legislature therefore finds that in the interest of remedying harms resulting from the enforcement of cannabis-related laws in disproportionately impacted areas, creating a social equity program will further an equitable cannabis industry by promoting business ownership among individuals who have resided in areas of high poverty and high enforcement of cannabis-related laws. The social equity program should offer, among other things, financial and technical assistance and license application benefits to individuals most directly and adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws who are interested in starting cannabis business enterprises. It is the intent of the legislature that implementation of the social equity program authorized by this act not result in an increase in the number of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> retailer licenses above the limit on the number of <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">marijuana [cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">cannabis</TextRun> retailer licenses in the state established by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">[Washington state liquor and cannabis]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">Washington state liquor and cannabis</TextRun> board before January 1, 2020.</P>

The need for well-trained staff and well-managed facilities is growing as the state's population ages and the acuity of the health care problems of residents increases. In order to better protect and care for residents, the legislature directs that the minimum training standards be reviewed for management and caregiving staff, including those serving residents with special needs, such as mental illness, dementia, or a developmental disability, that management and caregiving staff receive appropriate training, and that the training delivery system be improved."

Such direction must be for acts which are within the scope of registered nursing practice.</P>
<P>(3) A registered nurse may delegate tasks of nursing care to other individuals where the registered nurse determines that it is in the best interest of the patient.</P>
<P>(a) The delegating nurse shall:</P>
<P>(i) Determine the competency of the individual to perform the tasks;</P>
<P>(ii) Evaluate the appropriateness of the delegation;</P>
<P>(iii) Supervise the actions of the person performing the delegated task; and</P>
<P>(iv) Delegate only those tasks that are within the registered nurse's scope of practice.</P>
<P>(b) A registered nurse, working for a home health or hospice agency regulated under chapter 70.127 RCW, may delegate the application, instillation, or insertion of medications to a registered or certified nursing assistant under a plan of care.</P>
<P>(c) Except as authorized in (b) or (e) of this subsection, a registered nurse may not delegate the administration of medications. Except as authorized in (e) or (f) of this subsection, a registered nurse may not delegate acts requiring substantial skill, and may not delegate piercing or severing of tissues. Acts that require nursing judgment shall not be delegated.</P>
<P>(d) No person may coerce a nurse into compromising patient safety by requiring the nurse to delegate if the nurse determines that it is inappropriate to do so. Nurses shall not be subject to any employer reprisal or disciplinary action by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">nursing care quality assurance commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">board</TextRun> for refusing to delegate tasks or refusing to provide the required training for delegation if the nurse determines delegation may compromise patient safety.</P>
<P>(e) For delegation in community-based care settings or in-home care settings, a registered nurse may delegate nursing care tasks only to registered or certified nursing assistants under chapter 18.88A RCW or home care aides certified under chapter 18.88B RCW. Simple care tasks such as blood pressure monitoring, personal care service, diabetic insulin device set up, verbal verification of insulin dosage for sight-impaired individuals, or other tasks as defined by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">nursing care quality assurance commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">board</TextRun> are exempted from this requirement.</P>
<P>(i) "Community-based care settings" includes: Community residential programs for people with developmental disabilities, certified by the department of social and health services under chapter 71A.12 RCW; adult family homes licensed under chapter 70.128 RCW; and assisted living facilities licensed under chapter 18.20 RCW. Community-based care settings do not include acute care or skilled nursing facilities.</P>
<P>(ii) "In-home care settings" include an individual's place of temporary or permanent residence, but does not include acute care or skilled nursing facilities, and does not include community-based care settings as defined in (e)(i) of this subsection.</P>
<P>(iii) Delegation of nursing care tasks in community-based care settings and in-home care settings is only allowed for individuals who have a stable and predictable condition. "Stable and predictable condition" means a situation in which the individual's clinical and behavioral status is known and does not require the frequent presence and evaluation of a registered nurse.</P>
<P>(iv) The determination of the appropriateness of delegation of a nursing task is at the discretion of the registered nurse. Other than delegation of the administration of insulin by injection for the purpose of caring for individuals with diabetes, the administration of medications by injection, sterile procedures, and central line maintenance may never be delegated.</P>
<P>(v) When delegating insulin injections under this section, the registered nurse delegator must instruct the individual regarding proper injection procedures and the use of insulin, demonstrate proper injection procedures, and must supervise and evaluate the individual performing the delegated task as required by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">board</TextRun> by rule. If the registered nurse delegator determines that the individual is competent to perform the injection properly and safely, supervision and evaluation shall occur at an interval determined by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">board</TextRun> by rule.</P>
<P>(vi)(A) The registered nurse shall verify that the nursing assistant or home care aide, as the case may be, has completed the required core nurse delegation training required in chapter 18.88A or 18.88B RCW prior to authorizing delegation.</P>
<P>(B) Before commencing any specific nursing tasks authorized to be delegated in this section, a home care aide must be certified pursuant to chapter 18.88B RCW and must comply with RCW 18.88B.070.</P>
<P>(vii) The nurse is accountable for his or her own individual actions in the delegation process. Nurses acting within the protocols of their delegation authority are immune from liability for any action performed in the course of their delegation duties.</P>
<P>(viii) Nursing task delegation protocols are not intended to regulate the settings in which delegation may occur, but are intended to ensure that nursing care services have a consistent standard of practice upon which the public and the profession may rely, and to safeguard the authority of the nurse to make independent professional decisions regarding the delegation of a task.</P>
<P>(f) The delegation of nursing care tasks only to registered or certified nursing assistants under chapter 18.88A RCW or to home care aides certified under chapter 18.88B RCW may include glucose monitoring and testing.</P>
<P>(g) The <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">nursing care quality assurance commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">board</TextRun> may adopt rules to implement this section.</P>
<P>(4) Only a person licensed as a registered nurse may instruct nurses in technical subjects pertaining to nursing.</P>
<P>(5) Only a person licensed as a registered nurse may hold herself or himself out to the public or designate herself or himself as a registered nurse.</P>

<P>(1) The legislature recognizes that nurses have been successfully delegating nursing care tasks to family members and others for many years. The opportunity for a nurse to delegate nursing care tasks to home care aides certified under this chapter may enhance the viability and quality of health care services in community-based care settings and in-home care settings to allow individuals to live as independently as possible with maximum safeguards.</P>
<P>(2)(a) A certified home care aide who wishes to perform a nurse delegated task pursuant to RCW 18.79.260 must complete nurse delegation core training under chapter 18.88A RCW before the home care aide may be delegated a nursing care task by a registered nurse delegator. Before administering insulin, a home care aide must also complete the specialized diabetes nurse delegation training under chapter 18.88A RCW. Before commencing any specific nursing care tasks authorized under RCW 18.79.260, the home care aide must:</P>
<P>(i) Provide to the delegating nurse a transcript or certificate of successful completion of training issued by an approved instructor or approved training entity indicating the completion of basic core nurse delegation training; and</P>
<P>(ii) Meet any additional training requirements mandated by the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">nursing care quality assurance commission</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">state board of nursing</TextRun>. Any exception to these training requirements is subject to RCW 18.79.260(3)(e)(vi).</P>
<P>(b) In addition to meeting the requirements of (a) of this subsection, before providing delegated nursing care tasks that involve administration of insulin by injection to individuals with diabetes, the home care aide must provide to the delegating nurse a transcript or certificate of successful completion of training issued by an approved instructor or approved training entity indicating completion of specialized diabetes nurse delegation training. The training must include, but is not limited to, instruction regarding diabetes, insulin, sliding scale insulin orders, and proper injection procedures.</P>
<P>(3) The home care aide is accountable for his or her own individual actions in the delegation process. Home care aides accurately following written delegation instructions from a registered nurse are immune from liability regarding the performance of the delegated duties.</P>
<P>(4) Home care aides are not subject to any employer reprisal or disciplinary action by the secretary for refusing to accept delegation of a nursing care task based on his or her concerns about patient safety issues. No provider of a community-based care setting as defined in RCW 18.79.260, or in-home services agency as defined in RCW 70.127.010, may discriminate or retaliate in any manner against a person because the person made a complaint about the nurse delegation process or cooperated in the investigation of the complaint.</P>

<P>(b) Regulate the proof of accident and extent thereof, the proof of death, and the proof of relationship and the extent of dependency;</P>
<P>(c) Supervise the medical, surgical, and hospital treatment to the intent that it may be in all cases efficient and up to the recognized standard of modern surgery;</P>
<P>(d) Issue proper receipts for moneys received and certificates for benefits accrued or accruing;</P>
<P>(e) Designate a medical director who is licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW;</P>
<P>(f) Supervise the providing of prompt and efficient care and treatment, including care provided by physician assistants governed by the provisions of chapter 18.71A RCW, including chiropractic care, and including care provided by licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioners</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurses</TextRun>, to victims at the least cost consistent with promptness and efficiency, without discrimination or favoritism, and with as great uniformity as the various and diverse surrounding circumstances and locations of industries will permit and to that end shall, from time to time, establish and adopt and supervise the administration of printed forms, electronic communications, rules, regulations, and practices for the furnishing of such care and treatment. The medical coverage decisions of the department do not constitute a "rule" as used in RCW 34.05.010(16), nor are such decisions subject to the rule<Hyphen type="nobreak" />making provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW except that criteria for establishing medical coverage decisions shall be adopted by rule. The department may recommend to a victim particular health care services and providers where specialized treatment is indicated or where cost-effective payment levels or rates are obtained by the department, and the department may enter into contracts for goods and services including, but not limited to, durable medical equipment so long as statewide access to quality service is maintained for injured victims;</P>
<P>(g) In consultation with interested persons, establish and, in his or her discretion, periodically change as may be necessary, and make available a fee schedule of the maximum charges to be made by any physician, surgeon, chiropractor, hospital, druggist, licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, physician assistants as defined in chapter 18.71A RCW, acting under the supervision of or in coordination with a participating physician, as defined in RCW 18.71A.010, or other agency or person rendering services to victims. The department shall coordinate with other state purchasers of health care services to establish as much consistency and uniformity in billing and coding practices as possible, taking into account the unique requirements and differences between programs. No service covered under this title, including services provided to victims, whether aliens or other victims, who are not residing in the United States at the time of receiving the services, shall be charged or paid at a rate or rates exceeding those specified in such fee schedule, and no contract providing for greater fees shall be valid as to the excess. The establishment of such a schedule, exclusive of conversion factors, does not constitute "agency action" as used in RCW 34.05.010(3), nor does such a fee schedule constitute a "rule" as used in RCW 34.05.010(16). Payments for providers' services under the fee schedule established pursuant to this subsection (2) may not be less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program under Title 51 RCW, provided:</P>
<P>(i) If the department, using caseload estimates, projects a deficit in funding for the program by July 15th for the following fiscal year, the director shall notify the governor and the appropriate committees of the legislature and request funding sufficient to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program. If sufficient funding is not provided to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule for the following fiscal year based on caseload estimates and available funding, except payments may not be reduced to less than seventy percent of payments for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</P>
<P>(ii) If an unforeseeable catastrophic event results in insufficient funding to continue payments to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, the director shall reduce the payments under the fee schedule to not less than seventy percent of payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program, provided that the reduction may not be more than necessary to fund benefits under the program; and</P>
<P>(iii) Once sufficient funding is provided or otherwise available, the director shall increase the payments under the fee schedule to not less than payments provided for comparable services under the workers' compensation program;</P>
<P>(h) Make a record of the commencement of every disability and the termination thereof and, when bills are rendered for the care and treatment of injured victims, shall approve and pay those which conform to the adopted rules, regulations, established fee schedules, and practices of the director and may reject any bill or item thereof incurred in violation of the principles laid down in this section or the rules, regulations, or the established fee schedules and rules and regulations adopted under it.</P>
<P>(3) The director and his or her authorized assistants:</P>
<P>(a) Have power to issue subpoenas to enforce the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production and examination of books, papers, photographs, tapes, and records before the department in connection with any claim made to the department or any billing submitted to the department. The superior court has the power to enforce any such subpoena by proper proceedings;</P>
<P>(b)(i) May apply for and obtain a superior court order approving and authorizing a subpoena in advance of its issuance. The application may be made in the county where the subpoenaed person resides or is found, or the county where the subpoenaed records or documents are located, or in Thurston county. The application must (A) state that an order is sought pursuant to this subsection; (B) adequately specify the records, documents, or testimony; and (C) declare under oath that an investigation is being conducted for a lawfully authorized purpose related to an investigation within the department's authority and that the subpoenaed documents or testimony are reasonably related to an investigation within the department's authority.</P>
<P>(ii) Where the application under this subsection (3)(b) is made to the satisfaction of the court, the court must issue an order approving the subpoena. An order under this subsection constitutes authority of law for the agency to subpoena the records or testimony.</P>
<P>(iii) The director and his or her authorized assistants may seek approval and a court may issue an order under this subsection without prior notice to any person, including the person to whom the subpoena is directed and the person who is the subject of an investigation.</P>
<P>(4) In all hearings, actions, or proceedings before the department, any physician or licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> having theretofore examined or treated the claimant may be required to testify fully regarding such examination or treatment, and shall not be exempt from so testifying by reason of the relation of the physician or licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> to the patient.</P>

<P>(1) When the injury to any victim is so serious as to require the victim being taken from the place of injury to a place of treatment, reasonable transportation costs to and from the nearest place of proper treatment to a reasonable location of the victim's choice shall be reimbursed by the department as part of the victim's total claim under RCW 7.68.070(1).</P>
<P>(2) In the case of alleged rape or molestation of a child, the reasonable costs of a colposcopy examination shall be reimbursed by the department. Costs for a colposcopy examination given under this subsection shall not be included as part of the victim's total claim under RCW 7.68.070(1).</P>
<P>(3) The director shall adopt rules for fees and charges for hospital, clinic, medical, and other health care services, including fees and costs for durable medical equipment, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and other medically necessary devices for crime victims under this chapter. The director shall set these service levels and fees at a level no lower than those established for comparable services under the workers' compensation program under Title 51 RCW, except the director shall comply with the requirements of RCW 7.68.030(2)(g) (i) through (iii) when setting service levels and fees, including reducing levels and fees when required. In establishing fees for medical and other health care services, the director shall consider the director's duty to purchase health care in a prudent, cost-effective manner. The director shall establish rules adopted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require the payment of interest on any billing, fee, or charge.</P>
<P>(4) Whenever the director deems it necessary in order to resolve any medical issue, a victim shall submit to examination by a physician or physicians selected by the director, with the rendition of a report to the person ordering the examination.

Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, up to 12 counseling sessions may be received after the crime victim's claim has been allowed. Fees for counseling shall be determined by the department in accordance with and subject to this section.

In order to effectively accomplish such purpose and to assure that the victim receives such services as are paid for by the state of Washington, the acceptance by the victim of such services, and the request by a provider of services for reimbursement for providing such services, shall authorize the director of the department or the director's authorized representative to inspect and audit all records in connection with the provision of such services. In the conduct of such audits or investigations, the director or the director's authorized representatives may:</P>

Firearms equipped with large capacity magazines increase casualties by allowing a shooter to keep firing for longer periods of time without reloading. Large capacity magazines have been used in all 10 of the deadliest mass shootings since 2009, and mass shooting events from 2009 to 2018 where the use of large capacity magazines caused twice as many deaths and 14 times as many injuries. Documentary evidence following gun rampages, including the 2014 shooting at Seattle Pacific University, reveals many instances where victims were able to escape or disarm the shooter during a pause to reload, and such opportunities are necessarily reduced when large capacity magazines are used. In addition, firearms equipped with large capacity magazines account for an estimated 22 to 36 percent of crime guns and up to 40 percent of crime guns used in serious violent crimes. Based on this evidence, and on studies showing that mass shooting fatalities declined during the 10-year period when the federal assault weapon and large capacity magazine ban was in effect, the legislature finds that restricting the sale, manufacture, and distribution of large capacity magazines is likely to reduce gun deaths and injuries. The legislature further finds that this is a well-calibrated policy based on evidence that magazine capacity limits do not interfere with responsible, lawful self-defense. The legislature further finds that the threats to public safety posed by large capacity magazines are heightened given current conditions. Our country is in the midst of a pandemic, economic recession, social tensions, and reckonings over racial justice. The years 2020 and 2021 have seen a sharp increase in gun sales and gun violence, as well as fears over gun violence and incidents of armed intimidation. In this volatile atmosphere, the legislature declares that it is time to enhance public health and safety by limiting the sale of large capacity magazines. The legislature intends to limit the prospective sale of large capacity magazines, while allowing existing legal owners to retain the large capacity magazines they currently own."

Criminal and public safety background checks are an effective and easy mechanism to ensure that guns are not purchased by or transferred to those who are prohibited from possessing them. Criminal and public safety background checks also reduce illegal gun trafficking. Because Washington's current background check requirements apply only to sales or transfers by licensed firearms dealers, many guns are sold or transferred without a criminal and public safety background check, allowing criminals and dangerously mentally ill individuals to gain access to guns.</NoteP><NoteP>Conducting criminal and public safety background checks will help ensure that all persons buying guns are legally eligible to do so. The people find that it is in the public interest to strengthen our background check system by extending the requirement for a background check to apply to all gun sales and transfers in the state, except as permitted herein. To encourage compliance with background check requirements, the sales tax imposed by RCW 82.08.020 would not apply to the sale or transfer of any firearms between two unlicensed persons if the unlicensed persons have complied with all background check requirements.</NoteP><NoteP>This measure would extend criminal and public safety background checks to all gun sales or transfers.

The legislature further finds that, in order to adequately protect the public and in order to provide additional opportunities for mental health treatment for persons whose conduct threatens themselves or threatens public safety and has led to contact with the criminal justice system in the state, the determination of those criminal offenses that are "serious" offenses must be made consistently throughout the state. In order to facilitate this consistency, the legislature intends to determine those offenses that are serious in every case as well as the standards by which other offenses may be determined to be serious. The legislature also intends to clarify that a court may, to the extent permitted by federal law and required by the <TextRun fontStyle="italic">Sell</TextRun> decision, inquire into the civil commitment status of a defendant and may be told, if known."

<P>(1) One of the primary purposes of this section is to enable injured participants to return to their regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit. To this end, the state board shall utilize the services of individuals and organizations, public or private, whose experience, training, and interests in vocational rehabilitation and retraining qualify them to lend expert assistance to the state board in such programs of vocational rehabilitation as may be reasonable to make the participant return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit consistent with his or her physical and mental status. After evaluation and recommendation by such individuals or organizations and prior to final evaluation of the participant's permanent disability, if in the sole opinion of the state board, whether or not medical treatment has been concluded, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured participant to return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit, the state board may, in its sole discretion, pay the cost as provided in subsection (3) or (4) of this section.</P>
<P>(2) When, in the sole discretion of the state board, vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the participant return to his or her regular occupation, business, or profession, or to engage in any occupation or perform any work for compensation or profit, then the following order of priorities shall be used:</P>
<P>(a) Return to the previous job with the same employer;</P>
<P>(b) Modification of the previous job with the same employer including transitional return to work;</P>
<P>(c) A new job with the same employer in keeping with any limitations or restrictions;</P>
<P>(d) Modification of a new job with the same employer including transitional return to work;</P>
<P>(e) Modification of the previous job with a new employer;</P>
<P>(f) A new job with a new employer or self<Hyphen type="nobreak" />employment based upon transferable skills;</P>
<P>(g) Modification of a new job with a new employer;</P>
<P>(h) A new job with a new employer or self<Hyphen type="nobreak" />employment involving on<Hyphen type="nobreak" />the<Hyphen type="nobreak" />job training;</P>
<P>(i) Short<Hyphen type="nobreak" />term retraining and job placement.</P>
<P>(3)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, costs for vocational rehabilitation benefits allowed by the state board under subsection (1) of this section may include the cost of books, tuition, fees, supplies, equipment, transportation, child or dependent care, and other necessary expenses in an amount not to exceed four thousand dollars. This amount must be used within fifty-two weeks of the determination that vocational rehabilitation is permitted under this section.</P>
<P>(b) The expenses allowed under (a) of this subsection may include training fees for on<Hyphen type="nobreak" />the<Hyphen type="nobreak" />job training and the cost of furnishing tools and other equipment necessary for self<Hyphen type="nobreak" />employment or reemployment. However, compensation or payment of retraining with job placement expenses under (a) of this subsection may not be authorized for a period of more than fifty<Hyphen type="nobreak" />two weeks, except that such period may, in the sole discretion of the state board, after its review, be extended for an additional fifty<Hyphen type="nobreak" />two weeks or portion thereof by written order of the state board. However, under no circumstances shall the total amount of benefit paid under this section exceed four thousand dollars.</P>
<P>(4) In addition to the vocational rehabilitation expenditures provided for under subsection (3) of this section, an additional five thousand dollars may, upon authorization of the state board, be expended for: (a) Accommodations for an injured participant that are medically necessary for participation in an approved retraining plan; and (b) accommodations necessary to perform the essential functions of an occupation in which an injured participant is seeking employment, consistent with the retraining plan or the recommendations of a vocational evaluation. The injured participant's attending physician or licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> must verify the necessity of the modifications or accommodations. The total expenditures authorized in this subsection shall not exceed five thousand dollars.</P>
<P>(5) The state board shall follow the established criteria set forth by the department of labor and industries to monitor the quality and effectiveness of rehabilitation services provided by the individuals and organizations used under subsection (1) of this section. The state board shall make referrals for vocational rehabilitation services based on these performance criteria.</P>
<P>(6) The state board may engage, where feasible and cost<Hyphen type="nobreak" />effective, in a cooperative program with the state employment security department to provide job placement services under this section.</P>
<P>(7) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the vocational benefits provided for in this section are available to participants who have claims currently pending as of April 17, 2007, or whose injury occurred on or after January 1, 2006.</P>

The legislature further finds that there is a need for a robust public education campaign designed to raise awareness of suicide and to teach everyone the role that he or she can play in suicide prevention. The legislature further finds that important suicide prevention efforts include: Motivating households to improve safe storage practices to reduce deaths from firearms and prescription medications; decreasing barriers to prevent access to lethal means by allowing for temporary and voluntary transfers of firearms when individuals are at risk for suicide; increasing access to drug take-back sites; and making the public aware of suicide prevention steps, including recognizing warning signs, empathizing and listening, asking directly about suicide, removing dangers to ensure immediate safety, and getting help.

<P>(1) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, if the person's alcohol concentration is less than 0.08 or the person's THC concentration is less than 5.00, it is evidence that may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.</P>
<P>(2)(a) The breath analysis of the person's alcohol concentration shall be based upon grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath.</P>
<P>(b) The blood analysis of the person's THC concentration shall be based upon nanograms per milliliter of whole blood.</P>
<P>(c) The foregoing provisions of this section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug.</P>
<P>(3) Analysis of the person's blood or breath to be considered valid under the provisions of this section or RCW 46.61.502 or 46.61.504 shall have been performed according to methods approved by the state toxicologist and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the state toxicologist for this purpose. The state toxicologist is directed to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to supervise the examination of individuals to ascertain their qualifications and competence to conduct such analyses, and to issue permits which shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of the state toxicologist.</P>
<P>(4)(a) A breath test performed by any instrument approved by the state toxicologist shall be admissible at trial or in an administrative proceeding if the prosecution or department produces prima facie evidence of the following:</P>
<P>(i) The person who performed the test was authorized to perform such test by the state toxicologist;</P>
<P>(ii) The person being tested did not vomit or have anything to eat, drink, or smoke for at least fifteen minutes prior to administration of the test;</P>
<P>(iii) The person being tested did not have any foreign substances, not to include dental work or piercings, fixed or removable, in his or her mouth at the beginning of the fifteen-minute observation period;</P>
<P>(iv) Prior to the start of the test, the temperature of any liquid simulator solution utilized as an external standard, as measured by a thermometer approved of by the state toxicologist was thirty-four degrees centigrade plus or minus 0.3 degrees centigrade;</P>
<P>(v) The internal standard test resulted in the message "verified";</P>
<P>(vi) The two breath samples agree to within plus or minus ten percent of their mean to be determined by the method approved by the state toxicologist;</P>
<P>(vii) The result of the test of the liquid simulator solution external standard or dry gas external standard result did lie between .072 to .088 inclusive; and</P>
<P>(viii) All blank tests gave results of .000.</P>
<P>(b) For purposes of this section, "prima facie evidence" is evidence of sufficient circumstances that would support a logical and reasonable inference of the facts sought to be proved. In assessing whether there is sufficient evidence of the foundational facts, the court or administrative tribunal is to assume the truth of the prosecution's or department's evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in a light most favorable to the prosecution or department.</P>
<P>(c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the subject of the test from challenging the reliability or accuracy of the test, the reliability or functioning of the instrument, or any maintenance procedures. Such challenges, however, shall not preclude the admissibility of the test once the prosecution or department has made a prima facie showing of the requirements contained in (a) of this subsection. Instead, such challenges may be considered by the trier of fact in determining what weight to give to the test result.</P>
<P>(5) When a blood test is administered under the provisions of RCW 46.20.308, the withdrawal of blood for the purpose of determining its alcohol or drug content may be performed only by a physician licensed under chapter 18.71 RCW; an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 18.57 RCW; a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, or advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW; a physician assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A RCW; an advanced emergency medical technician or paramedic certified under chapter 18.71 RCW; or a medical assistant-certified or medical assistant-phlebotomist certified under chapter 18.360 RCW, a person holding another credential under Title 18 RCW whose scope of practice includes performing venous blood draws, or a forensic phlebotomist certified under chapter 18.360 RCW. When the blood test is performed outside the state of Washington, the withdrawal of blood for the purpose of determining its alcohol or drug content may be performed by any person who is authorized by the out-of-state jurisdiction to perform venous blood draws. Proof of qualification to draw blood may be established through the department of health's provider credential search. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath specimens.</P>
<P>(6) When a venous blood sample is performed by a forensic phlebotomist certified under chapter 18.360 RCW, it must be done under the following conditions:</P>
<P>(a) If taken at the scene, it must be performed in an ambulance or aid service vehicle licensed by the department of health under chapter 18.73 RCW.</P>
<P>(b) The collection of blood samples must not interfere with the provision of essential medical care.</P>
<P>(c) The blood sample must be collected using sterile equipment and the skin area of puncture must be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected.</P>
<P>(d) The person whose blood is collected must be seated, reclined, or lying down when the blood is collected.</P>
<P>(7) The person tested may have a licensed or certified health care provider listed in subsection (5) of this section, or a qualified technician, chemist, or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer one or more tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The test will be admissible if the person establishes the general acceptability of the testing technique or method. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.</P>
<P>(8) Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to him or her or his or her attorney.</P>

<P>(1) The legislature recognizes the role of health care providers as the appropriate authority to determine and establish the delivery of quality health care services to maternity patients and their newly born children. It is the intent of the legislature to recognize patient preference and the clinical sovereignty of providers as they make determinations regarding services provided and the length of time individual patients may need to remain in a health care facility after giving birth. It is not the intent of the legislature to diminish a carrier's ability to utilize managed care strategies but to ensure the clinical judgment of the provider is not undermined by restrictive carrier contracts or utilization review criteria that fail to recognize individual postpartum needs.</P>
<P>(2) Unless otherwise specifically provided, the following definitions apply throughout this section:</P>
<P>(a) "Attending provider" means a provider who: Has clinical hospital privileges consistent with RCW 70.43.020; is included in a provider network of the carrier that is providing coverage; and is a physician licensed under chapter 18.57 or 18.71 RCW, a certified nurse midwife licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW, a midwife licensed under chapter 18.50 RCW, a physician's assistant licensed under chapter 18.71A RCW, or an advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW.</P>

<P>(3)(a) Every health carrier that provides coverage for maternity services must permit the attending provider, in consultation with the mother, to make decisions on the length of inpatient stay, rather than making such decisions through contracts or agreements between providers, hospitals, and insurers. These decisions must be based on accepted medical practice.</P>
<P>(b) Covered eligible services may not be denied for inpatient, postdelivery care to a mother and her newly born child after a vaginal delivery or a cesarean section delivery for such care as ordered by the attending provider in consultation with the mother.</P>
<P>(c) At the time of discharge, determination of the type and location of follow-up care must be made by the attending provider in consultation with the mother rather than by contract or agreement between the hospital and the insurer. These decisions must be based on accepted medical practice.</P>
<P>(d) Covered eligible services may not be denied for follow-up care, including in-person care, as ordered by the attending provider in consultation with the mother. Coverage for providers of follow-up services must include, but need not be limited to, attending providers as defined in this section, home health agencies licensed under chapter 70.127 RCW, and registered nurses licensed under chapter 18.79 RCW.</P>
<P>(e) This section does not require attending providers to authorize care they believe to be medically unnecessary.</P>
<P>(f) Coverage for the newly born child must be no less than the coverage of the child's mother for no less than three weeks, even if there are separate hospital admissions.</P>
<P>(4) A carrier that provides coverage for maternity services may not deselect, terminate the services of, require additional documentation from, require additional utilization review of, reduce payments to, or otherwise provide financial disincentives to any attending provider or health care facility solely as a result of the attending provider or health care facility ordering care consistent with this section. This section does not prevent any insurer from reimbursing an attending provider or health care facility on a capitated, case rate, or other financial incentive basis.</P>
<P>(5) Every carrier that provides coverage for maternity services must provide notice to policyholders regarding the coverage required under this section. The notice must be in writing and must be transmitted at the earliest of the next mailing to the policyholder, the yearly summary of benefits sent to the policyholder, or January 1 of the year following June 6, 1996.</P>
<P>(6) This section does not establish a standard of medical care.</P>
<P>(7) This section applies to coverage for maternity services under a contract issued or renewed by a health carrier after June 6, 1996, and applies to plans operating under the health care authority under chapter 41.05 RCW beginning January 1, 1998.</P>

<P>(12) "Grandchild" means a child of the employee's child.</P>

<P>(b) Previously accrued compensation, other than severance pay or payments received pursuant to plant closure agreements, when assigned to a specific period of time by virtue of a collective bargaining agreement, individual employment contract, customary trade practice, or request of the individual compensated, is considered remuneration for the period to which it is assigned. Assignment clearly occurs when the compensation serves to make the individual eligible for all regular fringe benefits for the period to which the compensation is assigned.</P>
<P>(c) Remuneration also includes settlements or other proceeds received by an individual as a result of a negotiated settlement for termination of an individual written employment contract prior to its expiration date.

<P>(ii) Supplemental benefit payments made by an employer to an employee in addition to any paid family or medical leave benefits received by the employee; or</P>
<P>(iii) Payments to members of the armed forces of the United States, including the organized militia of the state of Washington, for the performance of duty for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours at a time.</P>
<P>(23)(a) "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:</P>
<P>(i) Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity; or</P>
<P>(ii) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any one or more of the following:</P>
<P>(A) A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves:</P>
<P>(I) Treatment two or more times, within thirty days of the first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist, by a health care provider, by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services, such as a physical therapist, under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or</P>
<P>(II) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider;</P>
<P>(B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care;</P>
<P>(C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:</P>
<P>(I) Requires periodic visits, defined as at least twice a year, for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider;</P>
<P>(II) Continues over an extended period of time, including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition; and</P>
<P>(III) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity, including asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy;</P>
<P>(D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider, including Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease; or</P>
<P>(E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments, including any period of recovery from the treatments, by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for: (I) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or (II) a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, severe arthritis, or kidney disease.</P>
<P>(b) The requirement in (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection for treatment by a health care provider means an in-person visit to a health care provider. The first, or only, in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity.</P>
<P>(c) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment is necessary within the thirty-day period shall be determined by the health care provider.</P>
<P>(d) The term extenuating circumstances in (a)(ii)(A)(I) of this subsection means circumstances beyond the employee's control that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by the health care provider. Whether a given set of circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed within the thirty-day period, but the health care provider does not have any available appointments during that time period.</P>
<P>(e) Treatment for purposes of (a) of this subsection includes, but is not limited to, examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under (a)(ii)(A)(II) of this subsection, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, but is not limited to, a course of prescription medication, such as an antibiotic, or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition, such as oxygen. A regimen of continuing treatment that includes taking over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves, or bed rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of this title.</P>
<P>(f) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are administered, such as most treatments for acne or plastic surgery, are not serious health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraines, routine dental or orthodontia problems, and periodontal disease are examples of conditions that are not serious health conditions and do not qualify for leave under this title. Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions provided all the other conditions of this section are met. Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of this section are met.</P>
<P>(g)(i) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this section are met. However, leave may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a licensed substance abuse treatment provider. Absence because of the employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for leave under this title.</P>
<P>(ii) Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an employer from taking employment action against an employee. The employer may not take action against the employee because the employee has exercised his or her right to take medical leave for treatment. However, if the employer has an established policy, applied in a nondiscriminatory manner that has been communicated to all employees, that provides under certain circumstances an employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the employee is presently taking medical leave. An employee may also take family leave to care for a covered family member who is receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employer may not take action against an employee who is providing care for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance abuse.</P>
<P>(h) Absences attributable to incapacity under (a)(ii)(B) or (C) of this subsection qualify for leave under this title even though the employee or the family member does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee's health care provider has advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.</P>
<P>(24) "Service is localized in this state" has the same meaning as described in RCW 50.04.120.</P>
<P>(25) "Spouse" means a husband or wife, as the case may be, or state registered domestic partner.</P>
<P>(26) "State average weekly wage" means the most recent average weekly wage calculated under RCW 50.04.355 and available on January 1st of each year.</P>
<P>(27) "Supplemental benefit payments" means payments made by an employer to an employee as salary continuation or as paid time off. Such payments must be in addition to any paid family or medical leave benefits the employee is receiving.</P>
<P>(28) "Typical workweek hours" means:</P>
<P>(a) For an hourly employee, the average number of hours worked per week by an employee within the qualifying period; and</P>
<P>(b) Forty hours for a salaried employee, regardless of the number of hours the salaried employee typically works.</P>
<P>(29) "Wage" or "wages" means:</P>
<P>(a) For the purpose of premium assessment, the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee. The maximum wages subject to a premium assessment are those wages as set by the commissioner under RCW 50A.10.030;</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of payment of benefits, the remuneration paid by one or more employers to an employee for employment during the employee's qualifying period. At the request of an employee, wages may be calculated on the basis of remuneration payable. The department shall notify each employee that wages are calculated on the basis of remuneration paid, but at the employee's request a redetermination may be performed and based on remuneration payable; and</P>
<P>(c) For the purpose of a self-employed person electing coverage under RCW 50A.10.010, the meaning is defined by rule.</P>

<P>(1) Whenever an employer has notice or knowledge of an injury or occupational disease sustained by any worker in his or her employment who has received treatment from a physician or a licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, has been hospitalized, disabled from work or has died as the apparent result of such injury or occupational disease, the employer shall immediately report the same to the department on forms prescribed by it. The report shall include:</P>
<P>(a) The name, address, and business of the employer;</P>
<P>(b) The name, address, and occupation of the worker;</P>
<P>(c) The date, time, cause, and nature of the injury or occupational disease;</P>

<P>(f) Such other pertinent information as the department may prescribe by regulation.</P>
<P>(2) The employer shall not engage in claim suppression. An employer found to have engaged in claim suppression shall be subject to a penalty of at least two hundred fifty dollars, not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars, for each offense. The penalty shall be payable to the supplemental pension fund. The department shall adopt rules establishing the amount of penalties, taking into account the size of the employer and whether there are prior findings of claim suppression. When a determination of claim suppression has been made, the employer shall be prohibited from any current or future participation in a retrospective rating program. If self<Hyphen type="nobreak" />insured, the director shall withdraw certification as provided in RCW 51.14.080.</P>
<P>(3) When a determination of claim suppression is made and the penalty is assessed, the department shall serve the employer and any affected retrospective rating group with a determination as provided in RCW 51.52.050. The determination may be protested to the department or appealed to the board of industrial insurance appeals. Once the order is final, the amount due shall be collected in accordance with the provisions of RCW 51.48.140 and 51.48.150.</P>
<P>(4) The director, or the director's designee, shall investigate reports or complaints that an employer has engaged in claim suppression as prohibited in RCW 51.28.010(3). The complaints or allegations must be received in writing, and must include the name or names of the individuals or organizations submitting the complaint. In cases where the department can show probable cause, the director may subpoena records from the employer, medical providers, and any other entity that the director believes may have relevant information. The director's investigative and subpoena authority in this subsection is limited solely to investigations into allegations of claim suppression or where the director has probable cause that claim suppression might have occurred.</P>
<P>(5) If the director determines that an employer has engaged in claim suppression and, as a result, the worker has not filed a claim for industrial insurance benefits as prescribed by law, then the director in his or her sole discretion may waive the time limits for filing a claim provided in RCW 51.28.050, if the complaint or allegation of claim suppression is received within two years of the worker's accident or exposure. For the director to exercise this discretion, the claim must be filed with the department within ninety days of the date the determination of claim suppression is issued.</P>

<P>(1) The legislature finds that high quality medical treatment and adherence to occupational health best practices can prevent disability and reduce loss of family income for workers, and lower labor and insurance costs for employers. Injured workers deserve high quality medical care in accordance with current health care best practices. To this end, the department shall establish minimum standards for providers who treat workers from both state fund and self-insured employers. The department shall establish a health care provider network to treat injured workers, and shall accept providers into the network who meet those minimum standards. The department shall convene an advisory group made up of representatives from or designees of the workers' compensation advisory committee and the industrial insurance medical and chiropractic advisory committees to consider and advise the department related to implementation of this section, including development of best practices treatment guidelines for providers in the network. The department shall also seek the input of various health care provider groups and associations concerning the network's implementation. Network providers must be required to follow the department's evidence-based coverage decisions and treatment guidelines, policies, and must be expected to follow other national treatment guidelines appropriate for their patient. The department, in collaboration with the advisory group, shall also establish additional best practice standards for providers to qualify for a second tier within the network, based on demonstrated use of occupational health best practices. This second tier is separate from and in addition to the centers for occupational health and education established under subsection (5) of this section.</P>
<P>(2)(a) Upon the occurrence of any injury to a worker entitled to compensation under the provisions of this title, he or she shall receive proper and necessary medical and surgical services at the hands of a physician, osteopathic physician, chiropractor, naturopath, podiatric physician, optometrist, dentist, licensed advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, physician assistant, or psychologist in claims solely for mental health conditions, of his or her own choice, if conveniently located, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, and proper and necessary hospital care and services during the period of his or her disability from such injury.</P>
<P>(b) Once the provider network is established in the worker's geographic area, an injured worker may receive care from a nonnetwork provider only for an initial office or emergency room visit. However, the department or self-insurer may limit reimbursement to the department's standard fee for the services. The provider must comply with all applicable billing policies and must accept the department's fee schedule as payment in full.</P>
<P>(c) The department, in collaboration with the advisory group, shall adopt policies for the development, credentialing, accreditation, and continued oversight of a network of health care providers approved to treat injured workers. Health care providers shall apply to the network by completing the department's provider application which shall have the force of a contract with the department to treat injured workers. The advisory group shall recommend minimum network standards for the department to approve a provider's application, to remove a provider from the network, or to require peer review such as, but not limited to:</P>
<P>(i) Current malpractice insurance coverage exceeding a dollar amount threshold, number, or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;</P>
<P>(ii) Previous malpractice judgments or settlements that do not exceed a dollar amount threshold recommended by the advisory group, or a specific number or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;</P>
<P>(iii) No licensing or disciplinary action in any jurisdiction or loss of treating or admitting privileges by any board, commission, agency, public or private health care payer, or hospital;</P>
<P>(iv) For some specialties such as surgeons, privileges in at least one hospital;</P>
<P>(v) Whether the provider has been credentialed by another health plan that follows national quality assurance guidelines; and</P>
<P>(vi) Alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan.</P>
<P>The department shall develop alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan or as needed to address access to care concerns in certain regions.</P>
<P>(d) Network provider contracts will automatically renew at the end of the contract period unless the department provides written notice of changes in contract provisions or the department or provider provides written notice of contract termination. The industrial insurance medical advisory committee shall develop criteria for removal of a provider from the network to be presented to the department and advisory group for consideration in the development of contract terms.</P>
<P>(e) In order to monitor quality of care and assure efficient management of the provider network, the department shall establish additional criteria and terms for network participation including, but not limited to, requiring compliance with administrative and billing policies.</P>
<P>(f) The advisory group shall recommend best practices standards to the department to use in determining second tier network providers. The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for network providers who qualify for the second tier. The department is authorized to certify and decertify second tier providers.</P>
<P>(3) The department shall work with self-insurers and the department utilization review provider to implement utilization review for the self-insured community to ensure consistent quality, cost-effective care for all injured workers and employers, and to reduce administrative burden for providers.</P>
<P>(4) The department for state fund claims shall pay, in accordance with the department's fee schedule, for any alleged injury for which a worker files a claim, any initial prescription drugs provided in relation to that initial visit, without regard to whether the worker's claim for benefits is allowed. In all accepted claims, treatment shall be limited in point of duration as follows:</P>
<P>In the case of permanent partial disability, not to extend beyond the date when compensation shall be awarded him or her, except when the worker returned to work before permanent partial disability award is made, in such case not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to him or her shall cease; in case of temporary disability not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to him or her shall cease: PROVIDED, That after any injured worker has returned to his or her work his or her medical and surgical treatment may be continued if, and so long as, such continuation is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to be necessary to his or her more complete recovery; in case of a permanent total disability not to extend beyond the date on which a lump sum settlement is made with him or her or he or she is placed upon the permanent pension roll: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the supervisor of industrial insurance, solely in his or her discretion, may authorize continued medical and surgical treatment for conditions previously accepted by the department when such medical and surgical treatment is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to protect such worker's life or provide for the administration of medical and therapeutic measures including payment of prescription medications, but not including those controlled substances currently scheduled by the pharmacy quality assurance commission as Schedule I, II, III, or IV substances under chapter 69.50 RCW, which are necessary to alleviate continuing pain which results from the industrial injury. In order to authorize such continued treatment the written order of the supervisor of industrial insurance issued in advance of the continuation shall be necessary.</P>
<P>The supervisor of industrial insurance, the supervisor's designee, or a self-insurer, in his or her sole discretion, may authorize inoculation or other immunological treatment in cases in which a work-related activity has resulted in probable exposure of the worker to a potential infectious occupational disease. Authorization of such treatment does not bind the department or self-insurer in any adjudication of a claim by the same worker or the worker's beneficiary for an occupational disease.</P>
<P>(5)(a) The legislature finds that the department and its business and labor partners have collaborated in establishing centers for occupational health and education to promote best practices and prevent preventable disability by focusing additional provider-based resources during the first twelve weeks following an injury. The centers for occupational health and education represent innovative accountable care systems in an early stage of development consistent with national health care reform efforts. Many Washington workers do not yet have access to these innovative health care delivery models.</P>
<P>(b) To expand evidence-based occupational health best practices, the department shall establish additional centers for occupational health and education, with the goal of extending access to at least fifty percent of injured and ill workers by December 2013 and to all injured workers by December 2015. The department shall also develop additional best practices and incentives that span the entire period of recovery, not only the first twelve weeks.</P>
<P>(c) The department shall certify and decertify centers for occupational health and education based on criteria including institutional leadership and geographic areas covered by the center for occupational health and education, occupational health leadership and education, mix of participating health care providers necessary to address the anticipated needs of injured workers, health services coordination to deliver occupational health best practices, indicators to measure the success of the center for occupational health and education, and agreement that the center's providers shall, if feasible, treat certain injured workers if referred by the department or a self-insurer.</P>
<P>(d) Health care delivery organizations may apply to the department for certification as a center for occupational health and education. These may include, but are not limited to, hospitals and affiliated clinics and providers, multispecialty clinics, health maintenance organizations, and organized systems of network physicians.</P>
<P>(e) The centers for occupational health and education shall implement benchmark quality indicators of occupational health best practices for individual providers, developed in collaboration with the department. A center for occupational health and education shall remove individual providers who do not consistently meet these quality benchmarks.</P>
<P>(f) The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for center for occupational health and education providers that are based on progressive and measurable gains in occupational health best practices, and that are applicable throughout the duration of an injured or ill worker's episode of care.</P>

This translates into incredible costs to individuals, families, and society in terms of traffic fatalities, suicides, criminal activity including homicides, sexual promiscuity, familial incorrigibility, and conduct disorders, and educational fallout. Among children of all socioeconomic groups lower expectations for the future, low motivation and self-esteem, alienation, and depression are associated with alcohol and drug abuse.</NoteP><NoteP>Studies reveal that deaths from alcohol and other drug-related injuries rise sharply through adolescence, peaking in the early twenties. But second peak occurs in later life, where it accounts for three times as many deaths from chronic diseases. A young victim's life expectancy is likely to be reduced by an average of twenty-six years.</NoteP><NoteP>Yet the cost of treating alcohol and drug addicts can be recouped in the first three years of abstinence in health care savings alone. Public money spent on treatment saves not only the life of the chemical abuser, it makes us safer as individuals, and in the long-run costs less.</NoteP><NoteP>The legislature further finds that many children who abuse alcohol and other drugs may not require involuntary treatment, but still are not adequately served. These children remain at risk for future chemical dependency, and may become mentally ill or a juvenile offender or need out-of-home placement. Children placed at risk because of chemical abuse may be better served by the creation of a comprehensive integrated system for children in crisis.</NoteP><NoteP>The legislature declares that an emphasis on the treatment of youth will pay the largest dividend in terms of preventable costs to individuals themselves, their families, and to society. The provision of augmented involuntary alcohol treatment services to youths, as well as involuntary treatment for youths addicted by other drugs, is in the interest of the public health and safety."

<P>(b) The waiver of a privilege under this section is limited to records or testimony relevant to evaluation of the detained person for purposes of a proceeding under this chapter. Upon motion by the detained person or on its own motion, the court shall examine a record or testimony sought by a petitioner to determine whether it is within the scope of the waiver.</P>
<P>(c) The record maker may not be required to testify in order to introduce medical or psychological records of the detained person so long as the requirements of RCW 5.45.020 are met except that portions of the record which contain opinions as to the detained person's mental state must be deleted from such records unless the person making such conclusions is available for cross-examination.</P>
<P>(8) Nothing contained in this chapter prohibits the patient from petitioning by writ of habeas corpus for release.</P>
<P>(9) Nothing in this section permits any person to knowingly violate a no-contact order or a condition of an active judgment and sentence or an active condition of supervision by the department of corrections.</P>

<P>(1) A principal who:</P>
<P>(a) Chose not to be able to revoke his or her directive during any period of incapacity;</P>
<P>(b) Consented to voluntary admission to inpatient behavioral health treatment, or authorized an agent to consent on the principal's behalf; and</P>
<P>(c) At the time of admission to inpatient treatment, refuses to be admitted, may only be admitted into inpatient behavioral health treatment under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
<P>(2) A principal may only be admitted to inpatient behavioral health treatment under his or her directive if, prior to admission, a member of the treating facility's professional staff who is a physician, physician assistant, or psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>:</P>
<P>(a) Evaluates the principal's mental condition, including a review of reasonably available psychiatric and psychological history, diagnosis, and treatment needs, and determines, in conjunction with another health care provider, mental health professional, or substance use disorder professional, that the principal is incapacitated;</P>
<P>(b) Obtains the informed consent of the agent, if any, designated in the directive;</P>
<P>(c) Makes a written determination that the principal needs an inpatient evaluation or is in need of inpatient treatment and that the evaluation or treatment cannot be accomplished in a less restrictive setting; and</P>
<P>(d) Documents in the principal's medical record a summary of the physician's, physician assistant's, or psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner's</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse's</TextRun> findings and recommendations for treatment or evaluation.</P>
<P>(3) In the event the admitting physician is not a psychiatrist, the admitting physician assistant is not working with a psychiatrist who is acting as a participating physician as defined in RCW 18.71A.010, or the advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> is not a psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, the principal shall receive a complete behavioral health assessment by a mental health professional or substance use disorder professional within 24 hours of admission to determine the continued need for inpatient evaluation or treatment.</P>
<P>(4)(a) If it is determined that the principal has capacity, then the principal may only be admitted to, or remain in, inpatient treatment if he or she consents at the time, is admitted for family-initiated treatment under chapter 71.34 RCW, or is detained under the involuntary treatment provisions of chapter 71.05 or 71.34 RCW.</P>
<P>(b) If a principal who is determined by two health care providers or one mental health professional or substance use disorder professional and one health care provider to be incapacitated continues to refuse inpatient treatment, the principal may immediately seek injunctive relief for release from the facility.</P>
<P>(5) If, at the end of the period of time that the principal or the principal's agent, if any, has consented to voluntary inpatient treatment, but no more than 14 days after admission, the principal has not regained capacity or has regained capacity but refuses to consent to remain for additional treatment, the principal must be released during reasonable daylight hours, unless detained under chapter 71.05 or 71.34 RCW.</P>
<P>(6)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, any principal who is voluntarily admitted to inpatient behavioral health treatment under this chapter shall have all the rights provided to individuals who are voluntarily admitted to inpatient treatment under chapter 71.05, 71.34, or 72.23 RCW.</P>
<P>(b) Notwithstanding RCW 71.05.050 regarding consent to inpatient treatment for a specified length of time, the choices an incapacitated principal expressed in his or her directive shall control, provided, however, that a principal who takes action demonstrating a desire to be discharged, in addition to making statements requesting to be discharged, shall be discharged, and no principal shall be restrained in any way in order to prevent his or her discharge. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent detention and evaluation for civil commitment under chapter 71.05 RCW.</P>
<P>(7) Consent to inpatient admission in a directive is effective only while the professional person, health care provider, and health care facility are in substantial compliance with the material provisions of the directive related to inpatient treatment.</P>

The legislature finds that because RCW 71.05.050 pertains to a variety of rights as well as the procedures for detaining a voluntary patient for evaluation for civil commitment, and the legislature intended only to address the right of release upon request, there is ambiguity as to whether an incapacitated person admitted pursuant to his or her mental health advance directive and seeking release can be held for evaluation for civil commitment under chapter 71.05 RCW. The legislature therefore intends to clarify the ambiguity without making any change to its intended policy as laid out in chapter 71.32 RCW." [2004 c 39 s 1.]</NoteP></AnnNote>

<P>(1) At any time during the minor's period of fourteen-day commitment, the professional person in charge may petition the court for an order requiring the minor to undergo an additional one hundred eighty-day period of treatment. The evidence in support of the petition shall be presented by the county prosecutor unless the petition is filed by the professional person in charge of a state-operated facility in which case the evidence shall be presented by the attorney general.</P>
<P>(2) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall contain the following:</P>
<P>(a) The name and address of the petitioner or petitioners;</P>
<P>(b) The name of the minor alleged to meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment;</P>
<P>(c) A statement that the petitioner is the professional person in charge of the evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility, or approved substance use disorder treatment program responsible for the treatment of the minor;</P>
<P>(d) The date of the fourteen-day commitment order; and</P>
<P>(e) A summary of the facts supporting the petition.</P>
<P>(3) The petition shall be supported by accompanying affidavits signed by: (a) Two examining physicians, one of whom shall be a child psychiatrist, or two psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioners</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurses</TextRun>, one of whom shall be a child and adolescent or family psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>. If the petition is for substance use disorder treatment, the petition may be signed by a substance use disorder professional instead of a mental health professional and by an advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun> instead of a psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, or two physician assistants, one of whom must be supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist; (b) one children's mental health specialist and either an examining physician, physician assistant, or a psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>; or (c) two among an examining physician, physician assistant, and a psychiatric advanced <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">registered nurse practitioner</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">practice registered nurse</TextRun>, one of which needs to be a child psychiatrist, a physician assistant supervised by or collaborating with a child psychiatrist, or a child and adolescent psychiatric nurse practitioner. The affidavits shall describe in detail the behavior of the detained minor which supports the petition and shall state whether a less restrictive alternative to inpatient treatment is in the best interests of the minor.</P>
<P>(4) The petition for one hundred eighty-day commitment shall be filed with the clerk of the court at least three days before the expiration of the fourteen-day commitment period. The petitioner or the petitioner's designee shall within twenty-four hours of filing serve a copy of the petition on the minor and notify the minor's attorney and the minor's parent. A copy of the petition shall be provided to such persons at least twenty-four hours prior to the hearing.</P>
<P>(5) At the time of filing, the court shall set a date within seven days for the hearing on the petition. If the hearing is not commenced within thirty days after the filing of the petition, including extensions of time requested by the detained person or his or her attorney or the court in the administration of justice under RCW 71.34.735, the minor must be released. The minor or the parents shall be afforded the same rights as in a fourteen-day commitment hearing. Treatment of the minor shall continue pending the proceeding.</P>
<P>(6) For one hundred eighty-day commitment, the court must find by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the minor:</P>
<P>(a) Is suffering from a mental disorder or substance use disorder;</P>
<P>(b) Presents a likelihood of serious harm or is gravely disabled; and</P>
<P>(c) Is in need of further treatment that only can be provided in a one hundred eighty-day commitment.</P>
<P>(7) In determining whether an inpatient or less restrictive alternative commitment is appropriate, great weight must be given to evidence of a prior history or pattern of decompensation and discontinuation of treatment resulting in: (a) Repeated hospitalizations; or (b) repeated peace officer interventions resulting in juvenile charges. Such evidence may be used to provide a factual basis for concluding that the minor would not receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.</P>
<P>(8)(a) If the court finds that the criteria for commitment are met and that less restrictive treatment in a community setting is not appropriate or available, the court shall order the minor committed to the custody of the director for further inpatient mental health treatment, to an approved substance use disorder treatment program for further substance use disorder treatment, or to a private treatment and evaluation facility for inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment if the minor's parents have assumed responsibility for payment for the treatment. If the court finds that a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the minor, the court shall order less restrictive alternative treatment upon such conditions as necessary.</P>
<P>(b) If the court determines that the minor does not meet the criteria for one hundred eighty-day commitment, the minor shall be released.</P>
<P>(9) Successive one hundred eighty-day commitments are permissible on the same grounds and under the same procedures as the original one hundred eighty-day commitment. Such petitions shall be filed at least three days prior to the expiration of the previous one hundred eighty-day commitment order.</P>

The examination of the adolescent may be performed by the qualified professional whose affidavit accompanied the petition. If the examination is performed by another qualified professional, the examining qualified professional shall be authorized to consult with the qualified professional whose affidavit accompanied the petition.</P>
<P>(g) If the adolescent has refused to be examined by a qualified professional and the court finds reasonable grounds to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, the court may issue a written order directing a peace officer who has completed crisis intervention training to detain and transport the adolescent to a provider for examination by a qualified professional. An adolescent detained pursuant to this subsection shall be detained no longer than necessary to complete the examination and in no event longer than 24 hours.
