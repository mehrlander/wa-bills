    "vetoNote": "Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows:\n\"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 5012, 5067 and 8038, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5200 entitled:\n\"AN ACT Relating to the capital budget.\"\nSection 5012, page 164, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Lapse of Funding\nFunding was provided to the agency to implement Substitute House Bill 1044 relating to capital financial assistance for small school districts. Because this bill did not pass the Legislature, the funding has lapsed. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 5012.\nSection 5067, page 179, The Evergreen State College, State Building Code Council Study\nThis section directs the Washington State Institute for Public Policy to study and report on the costs and benefits of moving from a three-year building code cycle to a six-year cycle. Increasing the time between code updates will impact the ability to apply the newest and best technologies for safety, health and efficiency to new construction in Washington. In addition, changing our state's code cycle to every six years will jeopardize the Legislature's mandate to reduce energy use 70% by 2031. Limiting the code cycles between now and 2031 would require a greater amount of change at each code cycle, increasing challenges for designers, builders and building owners. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 5067.\nSection 8038, pages 466-467, Department of Enterprise Services, Capitol Dome Access\nThis section directs the Department of Enterprise Services to give legislators and their guests access to the top of the Capitol dome. The Olympia Fire Department has assessed this space in the past, and, among other issues, reported that it could not use a firefighter's rescue technique in this space or use a gurney to assist an injured person. The Department of Labor and Industries classifies the area as a \"confined space,\" which means that it has a restricted entry and exit and is not primarily designed for human occupancy. Access should be authorized only for individuals who need to do work on the dome. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 8038.\nFor these reasons I have vetoed Sections 5012, 5067 and 8038 of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5200.\nWith the exception of Sections 5012, 5067 and 8038, Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5200 is approved.\"",
