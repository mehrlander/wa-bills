<BillSectionHeader><BillSectionNumber><TextRun>Sec. </TextRun><Value>1</Value><TextRun>.  </TextRun></BillSectionNumber><P>(1) A capital budget is hereby adopted and, subject to the provisions set forth in this act, the several dollar amounts hereinafter specified, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to accomplish the purposes designated, are hereby appropriated and authorized to be incurred for capital projects during the period beginning with the effective date of this act and ending June 30, 2027, out of the several funds specified in this act.</P></BillSectionHeader>
<P>(2) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</P>
<P>(a) "Fiscal year 2026" or "FY 2026" means the period beginning July 1, 2025, and ending June 30, 2026.</P>
<P>(b) "Fiscal year 2027" or "FY 2027" means the period beginning July 1, 2026, and ending June 30, 2027.</P>
<P>(c) "Lapse" or "revert" means the amount shall return to an unappropriated status.</P>
<P>(d) "Provided solely" means the specified amount may be spent only for the specified purpose.</P>
<P>(3) Unless otherwise specifically authorized in this act, any portion of an amount provided solely for a specified purpose that is not expended subject to the specified conditions and limitations to fulfill the specified purpose shall lapse.</P>
<P>(4) The amounts shown under the headings "Prior Biennia," "Future Biennia," and "Total" in this act are for informational purposes only and do not constitute legislative approval of these amounts. "Prior biennia" typically refers to the immediate prior biennium for reappropriations, but may refer to multiple biennia in the case of specific projects. A "future biennia" amount is an estimate of what may be appropriated for the project or program in the 2027-2029 biennium and the following three biennia; an amount of zero does not necessarily constitute legislative intent to not provide funding for the project or program in the future.</P>
<P>(5) "Reappropriations" in this act are appropriations and, unless the context clearly provides otherwise, are subject to the relevant conditions and limitations applicable to appropriations. Reappropriations shall be limited to the unexpended balances remaining on June 30, 2025, from the 2023-2025 biennial appropriations for each project.</P>

<CapitalProjectName>Capitol Lake-Deschutes Estuary Project (92000226)</CapitalProjectName>
<P prePadding="halfline">The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations:</P>
<P>(1) The legislature finds that the portion of the capital campus known as Capitol Lake is an important ecological and recreational resource for the State of Washington that was once connected to the Deschutes Estuary. Due to a lack of routine management over the last 25 to 50 years, the lake ecosystem is degraded, resulting in poor water quality, excessive algae growth, and invasive species proliferation.</P>
<P>The legislature further finds that the department of enterprise services has conducted significant outreach and study by engaging with the Squaxin Island Tribe, local municipal governments, the Port of Olympia, and other local stakeholders towards the goal of a long-term management solution that returns the lake to an estuary. The legislature acknowledges these efforts and partner commitments towards contributing to future maintenance and renewal but recognizes that the substantial investment necessary for the estuary restoration plan as currently proposed is not feasible. In an effort to both address the degraded lake water quality and identify a cost-effective approach to an estuary restoration that the state can responsibly support, the legislature intends to transfer management of this aquatic ecosystem to a state agency with natural resources expertise. Addressing the water quality of the lake will not only provide immediate benefit to the health of Capitol Lake and Budd Inlet, but also serve as a necessary precursor to a future estuary restoration.</P>
<P>(2) $8,000,000 of the appropriation in this section is provided solely for the department, in consultation with the department of enterprise services and office of the governor, for the Deschutes estuary restoration. The department shall use past reports and studies, consider existing stakeholder input, and critically consider elements of the current, but incomplete, department of enterprise services design. The updated design must include a recommended series of projects phased over several biennia with defined deliverable outcomes that move the state forward to a completed estuary. For each project phase, the plan shall identify expected timelines, estimated expenditures, and opportunities for non-state matching fund sources that contribute to the planned restoration and construction costs. The design may include only those elements associated with the construction of the estuary habitat, roadway and bridge improvements necessary to remove the existing 5th avenue bridge and associated necessary infrastructure and must minimize overall project cost. Recreational or pedestrian enhancement elements of the project must be designed as a separate bid package that could be added to the project at a future date, subject to the availability of funding appropriated for these elements.</P>
<P><TextRun lineVeto="yes">(3) $4,000,000 of the appropriation in this section is provided solely for the department to develop and implement a lake management plan to improve the water quality of Capitol Lake and begin the plan's implementation.</TextRun></P>
<P><TextRun lineVeto="yes">(a) The lake management plan must be developed with the goals of improving water quality and enhancing ecosystem structure and function. The plan must include lake management strategies that: Reduce the presence of algae; remove aquatic invasive species; mitigate decades of sediment accumulation; manage internal and external nutrient inputs, including those contributing to the impairment of dissolved oxygen levels in Budd Inlet; improve sediment quality by removing the accumulation of toxic contaminants and bioavailable phosphorous; and increase acreage of freshwater wetlands, restored shoreline, and native emergent vegetation. The plan must incorporate water quality data, bathymetric surveys, and other sampling and modeling data already collected as part of prior Capitol Lake and Deschutes Estuary studies.</TextRun></P>
<P><TextRun lineVeto="yes">(b) Management strategies identified to achieve the goals must be innovative and may include: The use of thermal treatments and saltwater backflushing for invasive species removal, direct algae control methods, circulation and aeration techniques, dredging, phosphorus sequestration, and other methods determined to be effective.

<CapitalProjectName>2025-2027 Voluntary Riparian Grant Program (40000049)</CapitalProjectName>
<P prePadding="halfline">The appropriations in this section are subject to the following conditions and limitations:</P>
<P>(1) The appropriations in this section are provided solely for the state conservation commission to provide grants for riparian restoration projects with landowners.</P>
<P>(2)(a) Within funds appropriated in this section, the commission shall develop and implement the voluntary riparian grant program to fund protection and restoration of critical riparian management zones. The commission is responsible for developing the voluntary grant program criteria to achieve optimal restoration of functioning riparian ecosystems in priority critical riparian management zones.</P>
<P>(b) In adopting program criteria, the commission shall:</P>
<P>(i) Invite federally recognized tribes to be full participants;</P>
<P>(ii) Coordinate with private landowners and other interested stakeholders;</P>
<P>(iii) Coordinate with the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, conservation districts, and the department of agriculture; and</P>
<P>(iv) Consider the best available, locally applicable science that is specific to each region of the state where the program criteria will be applied.</P>
<P>(3) The commission shall prioritize critical riparian management zones at the watershed or subbasin scale where grant funding under the program would be primarily targeted. The prioritization must be informed by, consistent with, and aligned with one or more of the following: Watershed plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.82 RCW; the action agenda developed under RCW 90.71.260; regional recovery plans created under RCW 77.85.090; the habitat project lists developed pursuant to RCW 77.85.050; the prioritization process developed under RCW 77.95.160; and priority projects identified for salmon recovery through agency grant programs.</P>
<P>(4) Conditions for awarding funding for projects under this program include, but are not limited to:</P>
<P>(a) Consistency with the program criteria established under subsection (2) of this section;</P>
<P>(b) Tiered incentive rates tied to improving functionality for riparian areas; and</P>
<P>(c) Other requirements as determined by the commission.</P>
<P>(5) The commission must distribute riparian grant program funding equitably throughout the state, consistent with received grant applications and benefit to salmon habitat. The legislature intends for funding to be primarily for projects located in salmon recovery regions, as defined in RCW 77.85.010, but funding may also be distributed to a project not located in a salmon recovery region upon a determination by the commission that the project will provide a unique benefit to salmon habitat.</P>
<P>(6) Allowable expenses to a grantee receiving funds under this section include, but are not limited to, labor, equipment, fencing, mulch, seed, seedling trees, manual weed control, and yearly maintenance costs for up to 10 years.</P>
<P>(7) Any native woody trees and shrubs planted with funding provided under this section must be maintained for a minimum of five years or as otherwise set by the commission for each grantee. Vegetation must be chosen to prevent invasive weed populations and ensure survival and successful establishment of plantings.</P>
<P>(8) The commission shall determine appropriate recordkeeping and data collection procedures required for program implementation and shall establish a data management system that allows for coordination between the commission and other state agencies. Any data collected or shared under this section may be used only to assess the success of the riparian grant program in improving the functions of critical riparian habitat.</P>
<P>(9) The commission shall develop and implement a framework that includes monitoring, adaptive management, and metrics in order to ensure consistency with the requirements of the riparian grant program. The monitoring and adaptive management framework may include, but is not limited to, consideration of:</P>
<P>(a) Acres identified as eligible for restoration within a watershed;</P>
<P>(b) Acres planned to be restored;</P>
<P>(c) Acres actually planted and maintained;</P>
<P>(d) Success in targeting and achieving aggregated project implementation resulting in an increase in linear miles restored;</P>
<P>(e) Plan review criteria; and</P>
<P>(f) Other similar factors as identified by the commission.</P>
<P>(10) The commission may use up to two percent of any amounts appropriated in this section for targeted outreach activities that focus on critically identified geographic locations for listed salmon species.</P>
<P>(11) The commission may use up to four percent of amounts appropriated in this section for administrative expenses.</P>
<P>(12) For the purposes of this section, "critical riparian management zone" means the area adjacent to freshwaters, wetlands, and marine waters that has been locally or regionally identified as an area where salmon recovery efforts would significantly benefit from enhanced protection or restoration.</P>
<P>(13) The state building construction account<TextRun fontFamily="Times New Roman">—</TextRun>state appropriation in this section is subject to the provisions of section 8018 of this act.</P>

<CapitalProjectName>Carbon Sequestration Forests (40000707)</CapitalProjectName>
<P prePadding="halfline">The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations:</P>
<P>(1) The appropriation in subsection (2) of this section is provided solely for the department to acquire working forestlands to be managed for increased carbon sequestration and carbon storage through sustainable timber harvests consistent with RCW 79.10.310 and 79.10.320. Pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, it is the intent of the legislature that these lands serve as harvestable replacement lands for structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands designated for conservation and for existing encumbered state forestlands. Once acquired, these replacement lands must be held in the land bank created in RCW 79.19.020. The replacement lands must be purchased before the transfer of any existing forested state trust lands pursuant to this section is fully executed. The department must transfer the appropriated amount into the land bank account in accordance with RCW 79.19.120.</P>
<P>(2)(a) If the department acquires replacement lands pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, it must use the replacement lands for the following purposes:</P>
<P>(i) To serve as replacement forested state trust lands to replace structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands designated for permanent conservation consistent with the process set forth in subsection (3) of this section in counties located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains, which may include, but are not limited to, Clallam, Thurston, Whatcom, Snohomish, Jefferson, and Pierce counties; or</P>
<P>(ii) To serve as replacement state forestlands to replace existing encumbered state forestlands in Clallam, Pacific, Skamania, and Wahkiakum counties.</P>
<P>(b) If the department acquires land pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, it must allocate the value of any land acquired as follows:</P>
<P>(i) Up to $10,000,000 for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section; and</P>
<P>(ii) Up to $10,000,000 for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section.</P>
<P>(c) The department must designate any lands acquired for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section as state forest transfer lands.</P>
<P>(3) The department may not designate for conservation any forested state trust lands pursuant to subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section unless the department has received letters of support from the legislative authority of the counties in which the parcel of forestland proposed for conservation is located, and the board of natural resources has approved the boundaries of the parcel proposed for conservation. County concurrence and board approval pursuant to this process must be finalized before any forested state trust lands may be transferred out of trust status pursuant to this section.</P>
<P>(4) If the department acquires any replacement lands pursuant to this section, the department must ensure that any replacement of structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands pursuant to subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section be of equal value to the land designated for conservation.</P>
<P>(5)(a) In the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the legislative authority of a county seeking to participate in the conservation opportunity described in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section may, for any state forestlands included within the lands designated for conservation, request that the department distribute to the county a portion of the current market value of the parcel as a one-time payment, subject to the requirement that the department must retain no less than $12,000 per acre to invest in replacement trust land. Upon such a request in writing, and subject to prior approval by the board, the department shall distribute to the county the requested portion of the market value as provided in RCW 79.64.110. Any amount distributed to a county as a one-time payment must be deducted from the amount available to purchase replacement trust land for that county.</P>
<P>(b) The county treasurer shall distribute any revenues received pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section to each appropriate taxing district in which the conserved forested state trust lands are located in the same manner as the revenues would otherwise be distributed if the revenues were received from timber harvest or other revenue-generating activities on such lands.</P>
<P>(6) In the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department may designate the structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands identified in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section as a natural area preserve or a natural resource conservation area notwithstanding the requirements of chapters 79.70 and 79.71 RCW.</P>
<P>(7) $3,000,000 of the appropriation is provided solely for the department to prepare commercial thinning timber sales for the purposes of restoring habitat, increasing carbon storage and sequestration, and facilitating access to more timber volume than is possible under normal operating funding.</P>
<P>(8) For the purposes of this section, "forested state trust lands" includes both "state forestlands" as defined in RCW 79.02.010 and forested "state lands" as defined in RCW 79.02.010.</P>

For purposes of this section, "total anticipated cost" means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project.</P></BillSectionHeader>
<P>(2) Appropriations for design may not be expended or encumbered until the office of financial management has reviewed and approved the agency's predesign.</P>
<P>(3) The predesign must explore at least three project alternatives. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. The chosen alternative should be the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The predesign document must include, but not be limited to, program, site, and cost analysis, and an analysis of the life-cycle costs of the alternatives explored, in accordance with the predesign manual adopted by the office of financial management.</P>
<P>(4) For projects exceeding the $10,000,000 predesign threshold established in this section, the office of financial management may make an exception to some or all of the predesign requirements in this section. The office of financial management shall report any exception to the fiscal committees of the legislature:</P>
<P>(a) A description of the major capital project for which the predesign waiver is made;</P>
<P>(b) An explanation of the reason for the waiver; and</P>
<P>(c) A rough order of magnitude cost estimate for the project's design and construction.</P>
<P>(5) In deliberations related to submitting an exception under this section, the office of financial management shall consider the following factors:</P>

To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.</P></BillSectionHeader>
<P>(2) Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. Agencies must choose the most reasonable and cost-effective solution, as supported by the life-cycle cost analysis. A brief description of each project alternative and why it was chosen must be included in the life-cycle cost analysis section of the predesign.</P>
<P>(3) The office of financial management shall: (a) Make available a life-cycle cost model to be used for analysis; (b) in consultation with the department of enterprise services, provide assistance in using the life-cycle cost model; and (c) update the life-cycle cost model annually including assumptions for inflation rates, discount rates, and energy rates.</P>

No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity of any facility beyond that intended in making the appropriation. Such transfers may be effected only between capital appropriations to a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education and only between capital projects that are funded from the same fund or account. No transfers may occur between projects to local government agencies except where the grants are provided within a single omnibus appropriation and where such transfers are specifically authorized by the implementing statutes that govern the grants.</P></BillSectionHeader>
<P>(2) The office of financial management may find that an amount is in excess of the amount required for the completion of a project only if: (a) The project as defined in the notes to the budget document is substantially complete and there are funds remaining; or (b) bids have been let on a project and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project as defined in the notes to the budget document can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated in this act.</P>

"Sustainable building" means a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:</P></BillSectionHeader>
<P>(1) Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building. Consider all stages of the building's life-cycle, including deconstruction.</P>
<P>(2) Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.</P>
<P>(3) Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by 50 percent below prerenovation baseline.</P>
<P>(4) On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.</P>
<P>(5) High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.</P>
<P>(6) Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used.

<P>(1) By October 1st of each even-numbered year, the office of financial management shall complete an objective analysis and scoring of all capital budget projects proposed by the public four-year institutions of higher education and submit the results of the scoring process to the legislative fiscal committees and the four-year institutions. Each project must be reviewed and scored within one of the following categories, according to the project's principal purpose. Each project may be scored in only one category. The categories are:</P>
<P>(a) Access<Hyphen type="nobreak" />related projects to accommodate enrollment growth at all campuses, at existing or new university centers, or through distance learning. Growth projects should provide significant additional student capacity. Proposed projects must demonstrate that they are based on solid enrollment demand projections, more cost<Hyphen type="nobreak" />effectively provide enrollment access than alternatives such as university centers and distance learning, and make cost<Hyphen type="nobreak" />effective use of existing and proposed new space;</P>
<P>(b) Projects that replace failing permanent buildings. Facilities that cannot be economically renovated are considered replacement projects. New space may be programmed for the same or a different use than the space being replaced and may include additions to improve access and enhance the relationship of program or support space;</P>
<P>(c) Projects that renovate facilities to restore building life and upgrade space to meet current program requirements. Renovation projects should represent a complete renovation of a total facility or an isolated wing of a facility. A reasonable renovation project should cost between sixty to eighty percent of current replacement value and restore the renovated area to at least twenty-five years of useful life. New space may be programmed for the same or a different use than the space being renovated and may include additions to improve access and enhance the relationship of program or support space;</P>
<P>(d) Major stand-alone campus infrastructure projects;</P>
<P>(e) Projects that promote economic growth and innovation through expanded research activity. The acquisition and installation of specialized equipment is authorized under this category; and</P>
<P>(f) Other project categories as determined by the office of financial management in consultation with the legislative fiscal committees.</P>
<P>(2) The office of financial management, in consultation with the legislative fiscal committees, shall establish a scoring system and process for each four-year project category that is based on the framework used in the community and technical college system of prioritization. Staff from the state board for community and technical colleges and the four-year institutions shall provide technical assistance on the development of a scoring system and process.</P>
<P>(3) The office of financial management shall consult with the legislative fiscal committees in the scoring of four-year institution project proposals, and may also solicit participation by independent experts.</P>
<P>(a) For each four-year project category, the scoring system must, at a minimum, include an evaluation of enrollment trends, reasonableness of cost, the ability of the project to enhance specific strategic master plan goals, age and condition of the facility if applicable, and impact on space utilization.</P>
<P>(b) Each four-year project category may include projects at the predesign, design, or construction funding phase.</P>
<P>(c) To the extent possible, the objective analysis and scoring system of all capital budget projects shall occur within the context of any and all performance agreements between the office of financial management and the governing board of a public, four-year institution of higher education that aligns goals, priorities, desired outcomes, flexibility, institutional mission, accountability, and levels of resources.</P>
<P>(4) In evaluating and scoring four-year institution projects, the office of financial management shall take into consideration project schedules that result in realistic, balanced, and predictable expenditure patterns over the ensuing three biennia.</P>
<P>(5) The office of financial management shall distribute common definitions, the scoring system, and other information required for the project proposal and scoring process as part of its biennial budget instructions. The office of financial management, in consultation with the legislative fiscal committees, shall develop common definitions that four-year institutions must use in developing their project proposals and lists under this section.</P>
<P>(6) In developing any scoring system for capital projects proposed by the four-year institutions, the office of financial management:</P>
<P>(a) Shall be provided with all required information by the four-year institutions as deemed necessary by the office of financial management;</P>
<P>(b) May utilize independent services to verify, sample, or evaluate information provided to the office of financial management by the four-year institutions; and</P>
<P>(c) Shall have full access to all data maintained by the joint legislative audit and review committee concerning the condition of higher education facilities.</P>
<P>(7) By August 1st of each even-numbered year each public four-year higher education institution shall prepare and submit prioritized lists of the individual projects proposed by the institution for the ensuing six-year period in each category. The lists must be submitted to the office of financial management and the legislative fiscal committees. The four-year institutions may aggregate minor works project proposals by primary purpose for ranking purposes. Proposed minor works projects must be prioritized within the aggregated proposal, and supporting documentation, including project descriptions and cost estimates, must be provided to the office of financial management and the legislative fiscal committees.</P>
<P>(8) For the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, by November 1, 2022, the office of financial management must score higher education capital project criteria with a rating scale that assesses how well a particular project satisfies those criteria. The office of financial management may not use a rating scale that weighs the importance of those criteria.</P>
<P>(9) For the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, pursuant to subsection (6)(a) of this section and in lieu of the requirements of subsection (7) of this section, by August 15, 2022, the institutions of higher education shall prepare and submit or resubmit to the office of financial management and the legislative fiscal committees:</P>
<P>(a) Individual project proposals developed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section;</P>
<P>(b) Individual project proposals scored in prior biennia pursuant to subsection (1) of this section; and</P>
<P>(c) A prioritized list of up to five project proposals submitted pursuant to (a) and (b) of this subsection.</P>
<P>(10) The requirements of this section are suspended during the 2023-2025 <TextRun amendingStyle="add">and 2025-2027</TextRun> fiscal <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">biennium</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">biennia</TextRun>. <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">However, instead of these requirements, the public four-year institutions of higher education must submit additional supporting information for major project funding requests for the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium that is equivalent to the information produced for the 2022 higher education scoring process under subsection (9) of this section. Examples of the information required under this subsection include, but are not limited to, measures of: (a) Space efficiency, (b) reasonableness of project cost, (c) facility condition, and (d) anticipated impacts of the requested major projects on projected degree totals. The public four-year institutions of higher education shall consult with the office of financial management and legislative fiscal staff regarding the implementation of this requirement and the content of the additional information.</TextRun></P>

<P>(1) The director of financial management shall provide all agencies with a complete set of instructions for submitting biennial budget requests to the director at least three months before agency budget documents are due into the office of financial management. The budget document or documents shall consist of the governor's budget message which shall be explanatory of the budget and shall contain an outline of the proposed financial policies of the state for the ensuing fiscal period, as well as an outline of the proposed six-year financial policies where applicable, and shall describe in connection therewith the important features of the budget. The biennial budget document or documents shall also describe performance indicators that demonstrate measurable progress towards priority results. The message shall set forth the reasons for salient changes from the previous fiscal period in expenditure and revenue items and shall explain any major changes in financial policy. Attached to the budget message shall be such supporting schedules, exhibits and other explanatory material in respect to both current operations and capital improvements as the governor shall deem to be useful to the legislature. The budget document or documents shall set forth a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period, or six-year period where applicable, based upon the estimated revenues and caseloads as approved by the economic and revenue forecast council and caseload forecast council or upon the estimated revenues and caseloads of the office of financial management for those funds, accounts, sources, and programs for which the forecast councils do not prepare an official forecast. Revenues shall be estimated for such fiscal period from the source and at the rates existing by law at the time of submission of the budget document, including the supplemental budgets submitted in the even-numbered years of a biennium. However, the estimated revenues and caseloads for use in the governor's budget document may be adjusted to reflect budgetary revenue transfers and revenue and caseload estimates dependent upon budgetary assumptions of enrollments, workloads, and caseloads. All adjustments to the approved estimated revenues and caseloads must be set forth in the budget document. The governor may additionally submit, as an appendix to each supplemental, biennial, or six-year agency budget or to the budget document or documents, a proposal for expenditures in the ensuing fiscal period from revenue sources derived from proposed changes in existing statutes.</P>
<P>The budget document or documents shall also contain:</P>
<P>(a) Revenues classified by fund and source for the immediately past fiscal period, those received or anticipated for the current fiscal period, and those anticipated for the ensuing biennium;</P>

<P>(f) The expenditures that include nonbudgeted, nonappropriated accounts outside the state treasury;</P>
<P>(g) Identification of all proposed direct expenditures to implement the Puget Sound water quality plan under chapter 90.71 RCW, shown by agency and in total; and</P>
<P>(h) Tabulations showing each postretirement adjustment by retirement system established after fiscal year 1991, to include, but not be limited to, estimated total payments made to the end of the previous biennial period, estimated payments for the present biennium, and estimated payments for the ensuing biennium.</P>
<P>(2) The budget document or documents shall include detailed estimates of all anticipated revenues applicable to proposed operating or capital expenditures and shall also include all proposed operating or capital expenditures. The total of beginning undesignated fund balance and estimated revenues less working capital and other reserves shall equal or exceed the total of proposed applicable expenditures. The budget document or documents shall further include:</P>
<P>(a) Interest, amortization and redemption charges on the state debt;</P>
<P>(b) Payments of all reliefs, judgments, and claims;</P>
<P>(c) Other statutory expenditures;</P>
<P>(d) Expenditures incident to the operation for each agency;</P>
<P>(e) Revenues derived from agency operations;</P>
<P>(f) Expenditures and revenues shall be given in comparative form showing those incurred or received for the immediately past fiscal period and those anticipated for the current biennium and next ensuing biennium;</P>
<P>(g) A showing and explanation of amounts of general fund and other funds obligations for debt service and any transfers of moneys that otherwise would have been available for appropriation;</P>
<P>(h) Common school expenditures on a fiscal-year basis;</P>
<P>(i) A showing, by agency, of the value and purpose of financing contracts for the lease/purchase or acquisition of personal or real property for the current and ensuing fiscal periods; and</P>

<P>(3) The governor's operating budget document or documents shall reflect the statewide priorities as required by RCW 43.88.090.</P>
<P>(4) The governor's operating budget document or documents shall identify activities that are not addressing the statewide priorities.</P>
<P>(5)(a) Beginning in the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, the governor's operating budget document or documents submitted to the legislature must leave, in total, a positive ending fund balance in the general fund and related funds.</P>

<P>(c) For purposes of this subsection:</P>
<P>(i) "Available fiscal resources" means the beginning general fund and related funds balances and any fiscal resources estimated for the general fund and related funds, adjusted for proposed revenue legislation, and with forecasted revenues adjusted to the greater of (A) the official general fund and related funds revenue forecast for the ensuing biennium, or (B) the official general fund and related funds forecast for the second fiscal year of the current fiscal biennium, increased by 4.5 percent for each fiscal year of the ensuing biennium.</P>

<P>(1) School construction assistance program grants for small school districts and state-tribal education compact schools must be determined in accordance with this section.</P>
<P>(2) Eligibility. School districts and state-tribal education compact schools with enrollments that are less than or equal to <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">one thousand</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">1,000</TextRun> students are eligible for small school district modernization grants. The advisory committee specified in subsection (4)(a) of this section may recommend amendments to the eligibility threshold as they learn more about the characteristics of school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are unable to modernize their aging school facilities. Districts with incomplete information in the inventory and condition of schools data system are not eligible to apply for construction grants but may apply for planning grants.</P>
<P>(3) The office of the superintendent of public instruction must assist eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are interested in applying for a small school district modernization grant under this section by providing technical assistance and planning grants within appropriations for this purpose. Districts and state-tribal education compact schools seeking planning grants must provide a brief statement of the school condition, its deficiencies, student enrollment, student achievement measures, and financial limitations of the district or state-tribal education compact school. If applications for planning grants exceed funds available, the office of the superintendent of public instruction may prioritize the recipients of planning grants in order to help districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most serious apparent building deficiencies, and the most limited financial capacity.</P>
<P>(4) Prioritized construction grants and advisory committee.</P>
<P>(a) The superintendent of public instruction must propose a list of prioritized grants to the governor by September 1st of even-numbered years. The superintendent of public instruction must appoint an advisory committee to prioritize applications from small school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. Committee members must have experience in financing, managing, repairing, and improving school facilities in small school districts or state-tribal education compact schools but must not be involved in a small school district modernization program grant request for the biennium under consideration. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide administrative and staff support to the <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">[advisory]</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">advisory</TextRun> committee. The office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the advisory committee must design a grant application process with specific criteria for prioritizing grant requests.</P>
<P>(b) The advisory committee created in (a) of this subsection must evaluate final applications from eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The advisory committee must submit a prioritized list of grants to the superintendent of public instruction. The list must prioritize applications to achieve the greatest improvement of school facilities, in the districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most limited financial capacity, for projects that are likely to improve student health, safety, and academic performance for the largest number of students for the amount of state grant support. The advisory committee must develop specific criteria to achieve the prioritization. The submitted prioritized list must describe the project, the proposed state funding level, and the estimated total project cost including other funding and in-kind resources. The list must also indicate student achievement measures that will be used to evaluate the benefits of the project. The superintendent of public instruction and the governor may determine the level of funding in their omnibus capital appropriations act requests to support small school district modernization grants, but their funding requests must follow the prioritized list prepared by the advisory committee unless new information determines that a specific project is no longer viable as proposed.</P>
<P>(5) Coordination with the school construction assistance program.</P>
<P>(a) The full administrative and procedural process of school construction assistance program funding under RCW 28A.525.162 through 28A.525.180 may be streamlined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in order to coordinate eligible school construction assistance program funding with the small school district modernization grants. Such coordination must ensure that total state funding from both grants does not exceed total project costs minus available local resources.</P>
<P>(b) Projects seeking small school district modernization grants must meet the requirements for a school construction assistance program grant except for the following: (i) The estimated cost of the project may be less than <TextRun amendingStyle="strike">forty</TextRun> <TextRun amendingStyle="add">40</TextRun> percent of the estimated replacement value of the facility, and (ii) local funding assistance percentage requirements of the school construction assistance program do not apply. However, available district and state-tribal education compact school resources are considered in prioritizing small school district modernization grants.</P>
<P>(6) Disbursement of grant funds and reporting requirements. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must award grants to school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The grant must not be awarded until the district or state-tribal education compact school has identified available local and other resources sufficient to complete the approved project considering the amount of the state grant. The grant must specify reporting requirements from the district or state-tribal education compact school, which must include updating all pertinent information in the inventory and condition of schools data system and submitting a final project report as specified by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the school facilities citizen<TextRun amendingStyle="strike">s [citizen]</TextRun> advisory panel specified in RCW 28A.525.025.</P>
<P><TextRun amendingStyle="add">(7) From the effective date of this section through June 30, 2027, school districts receiving a small district modernization grant under this section may not combine this grant funding either with a school construction assistance program grant or with other grants awarded under this section to fund a single project.</TextRun></P>

<P>(1) The stadium and exhibition center account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from the taxes imposed under RCW 82.14.0494 and distributions under RCW 67.70.240(1)(d) shall be deposited into the account. Only the director of the office of financial management or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW. An appropriation is not required for expenditures from this account.</P>
<P>(2) Until bonds are issued under RCW 43.99N.020, up to $5,000,000 per year beginning January 1, 1999, shall be used for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section, all remaining moneys in the account shall be transferred to the public stadium authority, created under RCW 36.102.020, to be used for public stadium authority operations and development of the stadium and exhibition center.</P>
<P>(3) After bonds are issued under RCW 43.99N.020, all moneys in the stadium and exhibition center account shall be used exclusively for the following purposes in the following priority:</P>
<P>(a) On or before June 30th of each year, the office of financial management shall accumulate in the stadium and exhibition center account an amount at least equal to the amount required in the next succeeding twelve months for the payment of principal of and interest on the bonds issued under RCW 43.99N.020;</P>
<P>(b) An additional reserve amount not in excess of the expected average annual principal and interest requirements of bonds issued under RCW 43.99N.020 shall be accumulated and maintained in the account, subject to withdrawal by the state treasurer at any time if necessary to meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection, and, following any withdrawal, reaccumulated from the first tax revenues and other amounts deposited in the account after meeting the requirements of (a) of this subsection; and</P>
<P>(c) The balance, if any, shall be transferred to the youth athletic facility account under subsection (4) of this section.</P>
<P>Any revenues derived from the taxes authorized by RCW 36.38.010(5) and 36.38.040 or other amounts that if used as provided under (a) and (b) of this subsection would cause the loss of any tax exemption under federal law for interest on bonds issued under RCW 43.99N.020 shall be deposited in and used exclusively for the purposes of the youth athletic facility account and shall not be used, directly or indirectly, as a source of payment of principal of or interest on bonds issued under RCW 43.99N.020, or to replace or reimburse other funds used for that purpose.</P>
<P>(4) Any moneys in the stadium and exhibition center account not required or permitted to be used for the purposes described in subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section shall be deposited in the youth athletic facility account hereby created in the state treasury. Expenditures from the account may be used only for purposes of grants or loans to cities, counties, and qualified nonprofit organizations for community outdoor athletic facilities. Only the director of the recreation and conservation office or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter 43.88 RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures. The athletic facility grants or loans may be used for acquiring, developing, equipping, maintaining, and improving community outdoor athletic facilities. Funds shall be divided equally between the development of new community outdoor athletic facilities, the improvement of existing community outdoor athletic facilities, and the maintenance of existing community outdoor athletic facilities. Cities, counties, and qualified nonprofit organizations must submit proposals for grants or loans from the account. To the extent that funds are available, cities, counties, and qualified nonprofit organizations must meet eligibility criteria as established by the director of the recreation and conservation office. The grants and loans shall be awarded on a competitive application process and the amount of the grant or loan shall be in proportion to the population of the city or county for where the community outdoor athletic facility is located. Grants or loans awarded in any one year need not be distributed in that year. The director of the recreation and conservation office may expend up to one and one-half percent of the moneys deposited in the account created in this subsection for administrative purposes. During the 2021-2023 fiscal biennium, the legislature may appropriate moneys from the youth athletic facility account to support a task force to consider ways to improve equitable access to K-12 schools' fields and athletic facilities and local parks agency facilities with the goal of increasing physical activity for youth and families. A portion of the appropriation must be used to inventory K-12 school fields and athletic facilities and park agency facilities.<TextRun fontWeight="bold" /></P>

The office's authority to retain 1.5 percent of amounts deposited in the account for administration is suspended, and the office's administrative overhead is instead specified in the appropriations for this purpose.</P>
<P>(b) During the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium, the legislature may also appropriate moneys in the youth athletic facility account for the following:</P>
<P>(i) To the department of commerce for the public facility improvement fund as provided in section 1038, chapter 474, Laws of 2023; and</P>

<P>(i) Extended grant agreements entered into under subsection (5)(a) of this section;</P>
<P>(ii) Grants or loans to local governments for remedial actions, including planning for adaptive reuse of properties as provided for under subsection (5)(d) of this section. The department must prioritize funding of remedial actions at:</P>

<P>(B) The director has found that the funding will achieve both a substantially more expeditious or enhanced cleanup than would otherwise occur, and the prevention or mitigation of unfair economic hardship;</P>
<P>(vi) Public funding to assist prospective purchasers to pay for the costs of remedial action in compliance with clean-up standards under RCW 70A.305.030(2)(e) if:</P>

To expedite cleanups throughout the state, the department may use the following strategies when providing grants to local governments under this subsection:</P>
<P>(a) Enter into an extended grant agreement with a local government conducting remedial actions at a facility where those actions extend over multiple biennia and the total eligible cost of those actions exceeds $20,000,000. The agreement is subject to the following limitations:</P>
<P>(i) The initial duration of such an agreement may not exceed 10 years. The department may extend the duration of such an agreement upon finding substantial progress has been made on remedial actions at the facility;</P>
<P>(ii) Extended grant agreements may not exceed 50 percent of the total eligible remedial action costs at the facility; and</P>
<P>(iii) The department may not allocate future funding to an extended grant agreement unless the local government has demonstrated to the department that funds awarded under the agreement during the previous biennium have been substantially expended or contracts have been entered into to substantially expend the funds;</P>
<P>(b) Enter into a grant agreement with a local government conducting a remedial action that provides for periodic reimbursement of remedial action costs as they are incurred as established in the agreement;</P>

<P>(i) Funding would prevent or mitigate unfair economic hardship imposed by the clean<Hyphen type="nobreak" />up liability;</P>
<P>(ii) Funding would create new substantial economic development, public recreational opportunities, or habitat restoration opportunities that would not otherwise occur; or</P>
<P>(iii) Funding would create an opportunity for acquisition and redevelopment of brownfield property under RCW 70A.305.040(5) that would not otherwise occur; and</P>
<P>(g) When pending grant applications under subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section exceed the amount of funds available, designated redevelopment opportunity zones must receive priority for distribution of available funds.</P>
<P>(6) Except for unanticipated receipts under RCW 43.79.260 through 43.79.282, moneys in model toxics control capital account may be spent only after appropriation by statute.</P>
<P>(7) The legislature finds that, in 2023, wildfires in Spokane and Pend Oreille counties resulted in a loss of approximately 366 homes as well as secondary buildings. The burning of these structures has resulted in a large toxic debris field containing asbestos, heavy metals, plastics, and fuel which are at risk of leaching into the soil and groundwater.

<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">Section 2038(4) requires the Department of Children, Youth, and Families to provide a cost estimate for additional juvenile rehabilitation capacity as part of its decision package for the 2026 supplemental budget. It is not reasonable for the agency to meet this timeline. For this reason, I am vetoing Section 2038(4). However, I am directing the department to submit a predesign to the Office of Financial Management and the appropriate committees of the Legislature no later than March 31, 2026, and to include a full plan of construction, including costs and schedule, as part of its decision package for consideration in the 2027-29 biennial budget.</P>

However, in light of future uncertainty with federal funding, I am directing the Department of Ecology to continue with a fresh look at cost effective options for the estuary restoration and to identify any other short-term actions needed, including improving the water quality of Capitol Lake.</P>

However, Sections 8018(2) and 8018(3) are constructed in a way that would be extremely difficult to implement. I also encourage the Legislature to consider the timelines of the Governor's budget when determining agency due dates. For these reasons, I am vetoing Sections 8018(2) and 8018(3).</P>

<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">Section 8036 is duplicative of Section 6 in Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1468, both of which create the same federal broadband account. For this reason, I am vetoing Section 8036.</P>
