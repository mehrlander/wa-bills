<P>(2) The department of social and health services shall not initiate any services that require expenditure of state general fund moneys unless expressly authorized in this act or other law. The department may seek, receive, and spend, under RCW 43.79.260 through 43.79.282, federal moneys not anticipated in this act as long as the federal funding does not require expenditure of state moneys for the program in excess of amounts anticipated in this act.

The office of the chief information officer shall maintain a statewide perspective when collaborating with the coalition to ensure that projects are planned for in a manner that ensures the efficient use of state resources, support the adoption of a cohesive technology and data architecture, and maximize federal financial participation. The work of the coalition is subject to the conditions, limitations, and review provided in section 701 of this act.</P>

If the certified public expenditures (CPE) program in its current form is no longer cost-effective to maintain, the health care authority shall submit a report to the governor and legislature detailing cost-effective alternative uses of local, state, and federal resources as a replacement for this program. During fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2025, hospitals in the program shall be paid and shall retain 100 percent of the federal portion of the allowable hospital cost for each medicaid inpatient fee-for-service claim payable by medical assistance and 100 percent of the federal portion of the maximum disproportionate share hospital payment allowable under federal regulations.

Inpatient medicaid payments shall be established using an allowable methodology that approximates the cost of claims submitted by the hospitals. Payments made to each hospital in the program in each fiscal year of the biennium shall be compared to a baseline amount.

If payments during the fiscal year are less than the baseline amount, the hospital will be paid a state grant equal to the difference between payments during the fiscal year and the applicable baseline amount. Payment of the state grant shall be made in the applicable fiscal year and distributed in monthly payments. The grants will be recalculated and redistributed as the baseline is updated during the fiscal year. The grant payments are subject to an interim settlement within 11 months after the end of the fiscal year. A final settlement shall be performed. To the extent that either settlement determines that a hospital has received funds in excess of what it would have received as described in this subsection, the hospital must repay the excess amounts to the state when requested. <TextRun amendingStyle="strikemarkleft">$237,000 of the general fund</TextRun><TextRun amendingStyle="strikemarknone"><TextRun fontFamily="Times New Roman">—</TextRun></TextRun><TextRun amendingStyle="strikemarknone">state appropriation for fiscal year 2024 and $218,000 of the general fund</TextRun><TextRun amendingStyle="strikemarknone"><TextRun fontFamily="Times New Roman">—</TextRun></TextRun><TextRun amendingStyle="strikemarkright">state appropriation for fiscal year 2025 are provided solely for state grants for the participating hospitals.</TextRun></P>

<P>(a) The department of veterans affairs shall not initiate any services that will require expenditure of state general fund moneys unless expressly authorized in this act or other law. The department may seek, receive, and spend, under RCW 43.79.260 through 43.79.282, federal moneys that are unrelated to the coronavirus response and not anticipated in this act as long as the federal funding does not require expenditure of state moneys for the program in excess of amounts anticipated in this act. If the department receives unanticipated unrestricted federal moneys that are unrelated to the coronavirus response, those moneys must be spent for services authorized in this act or in any other legislation that provides appropriation authority, and an equal amount of appropriated state moneys shall lapse. Upon the lapsing of any moneys under this subsection, the office of financial management shall notify the legislative fiscal committees. As used in this subsection, "unrestricted federal moneys" includes block grants and other funds that federal law does not require to be spent on specifically defined projects or matched on a formula basis by state funds.</P>
<P>(b) Each year, there is fluctuation in the revenue collected to support the operation of the state veteran homes. When the department has foreknowledge that revenue will decrease, such as from a loss of census or from the elimination of a program, the legislature expects the department to make reasonable efforts to reduce expenditures in a commensurate manner and to demonstrate that it has made such efforts. In response to any request by the department for general fund<TextRun fontFamily="Times New Roman">—</TextRun>state appropriation to backfill a loss of revenue, the legislature shall consider the department's efforts in reducing its expenditures in light of known or anticipated decreases to revenues.</P>

<P>(A) If the project is funded from the information technology revolving account, the technology budget must include a worksheet that provides the fund sources that were transferred into the account by fiscal year;</P>
<P>(B) If the project is by a central service agency, and funds are driven out by the central service model, the technology budget must provide a statewide impact by agency by fund as a worksheet in the technology budget file;</P>
<P>(ii) Full time equivalent staffing level to include job classification assumptions. This is to assure that the project has adequate state staffing and agency support to ensure success, ensure user acceptance, and adequately test the functionality being delivered in each sprint before it is accepted by the agency's contracting officer or their representative. Key project functions that are deemed "critical" must be retained by state personnel and not outsourced, to ensure that knowledge is retained within state government and that the state can self-sufficiently support the system and make improvements without long-term dependence on a vendor;</P>
<P>(iii) Discrete financial budget codes to include at least the appropriation index and program index;</P>
<P>(iv) Object and subobject codes of expenditures;</P>
<P>(v) Anticipated deliverables to include software demonstration dates;</P>
<P>(vi) Historical budget and expenditure detail by fiscal year; and</P>
<P>(vii) Maintenance and operations costs by fiscal year for at least five years as a separate worksheet.</P>
<P>(c) If a project technology budget changes and a revised technology budget is completed, a comparison of the revised technology budget to the last approved technology budget must be posted to the dashboard, to include a narrative rationale on what changed, why, and how that impacts the project in scope, budget, and schedule.</P>
<P>(5)(a) Each project must have a project charter. The charter must include:</P>
<P>(i) An organizational chart of the project management team that identifies team members and their roles and responsibilities, and shows that the project is adequately staffed by state personnel in key functions to ensure success;</P>
<P>(ii) The office of the chief information officer staff assigned to the project;</P>
<P>(iii) A project roadmap that includes the problems the team is solving and the sequence in which the team intends to take on those problems, updated periodically to reflect what has been learned;</P>
<P>(iv) Metrics to support the project strategy and vision, to determine that the project is incrementally meeting user needs;</P>
<P>(v) An implementation schedule covering activities, critical milestones, and deliverables at each stage of the project for the life of the project at each agency affected by the project;</P>
<P>(vi) Performance measures used to determine that the project is on time, within budget, and meeting expectations for quality of work product;</P>
<P>(vii) Ongoing maintenance and operations cost of the project post implementation and close out delineated by agency staffing, contracted staffing, and service level agreements; and</P>
<P>(viii) Financial budget coding to include at least discrete financial coding for the project.</P>
<P>(b) If required by the office of the chief information officer, a project may also need to have an investment plan. The office of the chief information officer must:</P>
<P>(i) Base the requirement of an agency needing to have an investment plan on the complexity and risk of the project;</P>
<P>(ii) Establish requirements by project risk level in statewide technology policy, and publish the requirements by September 30, 2023; and</P>
<P>(iii) In collaboration with the department of enterprise services, define the circumstances under which the vendor will be terminated or replaced and establish the process by which the agency will transition to a new vendor with a minimal reduction in project productivity.</P>
<P>(6)(a) Projects with estimated costs greater than $100,000,000 from initiation to completion and implementation may be divided into discrete subprojects as determined by the office of the chief information officer, except for the one Washington project which must be divided into the following discrete subprojects: Core financials, expanding financials and procurement, budget, and human resources. Each subproject must have a technology budget as provided in this section.</P>
<P>(b) If the project affects more than one agency:</P>
<P>(i) A separate technology budget and investment plan must be prepared by each agency; and</P>
<P>(ii) There must be a budget roll up that includes each affected agency at the subproject level.</P>
<P>(7) The office of the chief information officer shall maintain a statewide information technology project dashboard that provides updated information each fiscal month on projects subject to this section. The statewide dashboard must meet the requirements in section 155 of this act.</P>
<P>(8) For any project that exceeds $2,000,000 in total funds to complete, requires more than one biennium to complete, or is financed through financial contracts, bonds, or other indebtedness:</P>
<P>(a) Independent quality assurance services for the project must report independently to the office of the chief information officer;</P>
<P>(b) The office of the chief information officer, based on project risk assessments, may require additional quality assurance services and independent verification and validation services;</P>
<P>(c) The office of the chief information officer must review, and, if necessary, revise the proposed project to ensure it is flexible and adaptable to advances in technology;</P>
<P>(d) The technology budget must specifically identify the uses of any financing proceeds. No more than thirty percent of the financing proceeds may be used for payroll-related costs for state employees assigned to project management, installation, testing, or training;</P>
<P>(e) The agency must consult with the office of the state treasurer during the competitive procurement process to evaluate early in the process whether products and services to be solicited and the responsive bids from a solicitation may be financed;</P>
<P>(f) The agency must consult with the contracting division of the department of enterprise services for a review of all contracts and agreements related to the project's information technology procurements;</P>
<P>(g) The agency and project must use an agile development model holding live demonstrations of functioning software, developed using incremental user research, held at the end of every two-week sprint<TextRun amendingStyle="add">, except for:</TextRun></P>
<P><TextRun amendingStyle="add">(i) Hardware or infrastructure projects; and</TextRun></P>
<P><TextRun amendingStyle="add">(ii) Projects that have implemented all phases and are now in maintenance and operations</TextRun>;</P>
<P>(h) The project solution must be capable of being continually updated, as necessary; and</P>
<P>(i) The agency and project must deploy usable functionality into production for users within 180 days from the date of an executed procurement contract in response to a competitive request for proposal.</P>
<P>(9) The office of the chief information officer must evaluate the project at each stage and certify whether the project is putting functioning software into production that addresses user needs, is projected to be completed within budget, is in compliance with the quality assurance plan, and meets a defined set of industry best practices for code quality, and whether the project is planned, managed, and meeting deliverable targets as defined in the project's approved technology budget and investment plan.</P>
<P>(10) The office of the chief information officer may suspend or terminate a project at any time if it determines that the project is not meeting or not expected to meet anticipated performance and technology outcomes. Once suspension or termination occurs, the agency shall unallot any unused funding and shall not make any expenditure for the project without the approval of the office of financial management. The office of the chief information officer must report on December 1 each calendar year any suspension or termination of a project in the previous 12-month period to the legislative fiscal committees.</P>
<P>(11) The office of the chief information officer, in consultation with the office of financial management, may identify additional projects to be subject to this section, including projects that are not separately identified within an agency budget. The office of the chief information officer must report on December 1 each calendar year any additional projects to be subjected to this section that were identified in the previous 12-month period to the legislative fiscal committees.</P>
<P>(12) Any cost to administer or implement this section for projects listed in subsection (1) of this section, must be paid from the information technology investment revolving account.

<P>(1) The corrections personnel of the state and all counties and municipal corporations initially employed on or after January 1, 1982, shall engage in basic corrections training which complies with standards adopted by the commission.

<P>(b) The commission and the department of corrections share the responsibility of developing and defining training standards and providing training for community corrections officers employed within the community corrections division of the department of corrections.</P>

<P>(1)(a) The climate investment account is created in the state treasury. Except as otherwise provided in chapter 316, Laws of 2021, all receipts from the auction of allowances authorized in this chapter must be deposited into the account.

<P>Note: Governor's explanation of partial veto is as follows:</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">"I am returning herewith, without my approval as to Sections 114(10), 133(22), 222(27), 223(1)(k), 223(1)(l), 223(2)(v), 311(32), 522(3)(y), 602(105), 118(3), 202(33), 302(70), 502(4) and 507(11), Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill No. 5950 entitled:</P>
<P prePadding="halfline">"AN ACT Relating to fiscal matters."</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 114(10), page 23, Office of Public Defense, Pilot of Social Service Workers for Child Welfare Cases</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section directs the Office of Public Defense to contract for a social service workers pilot program to provide support and advocacy to indigent parents in dependency and termination cases. This pilot is duplicative of the casework currently performed by social workers at the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. This duplication may confuse and delay family participation in the services and supports needed to ensure safe and timely reunification. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 114(10).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 133(22), pages 174-175, Office of Financial Management, Elections Staff Study</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section directs the Office of Financial Management to conduct a study related to the hiring and retention of county elections staff, including staff members of a county auditor's office. In addition to inadequate funding, this proviso is administratively burdensome for the Secretary of State's Office and local elections offices especially during a presidential election year. It also does not provide sufficient time for this comprehensive study to be completed. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 133(22).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 222(27), page 463, Department of Health, Climate Commitment Act Funding for Environmental Justice Council</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section increases funding to implement the Healthy Environment for All (HEAL) Act at the Department of Health by $1.2 million. Language is also added that stops access to the new and existing funds if Initiative 2117 is approved by the voters. By vetoing this proviso, the department will retain the use of its original appropriation regardless of the outcome of the ballot measure. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 222(27). However, in recognition of the importance of this work, I encourage the Department of Health and the Environmental Justice Council, to the extent possible, to begin the enhanced activities intended with the supplemental funding.</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 223(1)(k), pages 499-501, Department of Corrections, Healthcare and Solitary Studies</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section directs the Department of Corrections to complete two reports: (1) a study of existing health care response with a proposed staffing model to ensure a 48-hour maximum response time, and (2) a review of solitary confinement including information about the amount of time individuals spend inside and outside their cells. The funding is insufficient to produce the reports, and much of the information about solitary confinement conditions and resource needs is already included in the department's 2023 Solitary Confinement Transformation Plan. We are making consistent investments to reduce the use of solitary confinement and to alleviate its known negative impacts. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 223(1)(k).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">However, because the health of individuals in the care of the state is so important, I am directing the Department of Corrections to assess medical request response times for incarcerated individuals and to request funding in the next budget to address outcomes from this assessment.</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 223(1)(l), pages 501-502, Department of Corrections, Staffing Review</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section directs the Department of Corrections to post monthly detailed staffing data to its external website and provide additional justification when making budget requests for additional funding and positions. This proviso is administratively burdensome. The department complies with existing requirements related to staffing information and budget requests. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 223(1)(l).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 223(2)(v), page 507, Department of Corrections, Juvenile Points Review</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section directs the Department of Corrections to review the conviction records of all offenders in confinement as of April 1, 2024 to determine whether juvenile convictions increased the person's offender score. The department would also be required to provide the information to the offenders' counties. The department does not have the legal expertise and access to court records necessary to make this determination for all individuals in confinement. In addition, the timeline and funding provided are insufficient. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 223(2)(v). However, I support continued efforts to ensure incarcerated individuals who were sentenced under laws that have since changed to have access to a resentencing review.</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 311(32), pages 643-644, Department of Agriculture, Review of Department of Health Commercial Shellfish Fees</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section requires the Department of Agriculture to review how the Department of Health establishes commercial shellfish regulatory fees. The section is similar to a Department of Health proviso to review the same regulatory fees. The approach established in Section 222(132) is preferrable because it provides more prescriptive language, directs the fee assessment to be completed by an independent third party, and includes funding for a LEAN management review of the shellfish licensing and certification program. For these reasons, I have vetoed Section 311(32).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 522(3)(y), page 742, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, Sexual Assault Training</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">While the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and I fully support this policy, it was inadvertently added to the budget twice, once in Section 127 and again in Section 522. Vetoing this duplicate appropriation will not impact the grant program and will keep the appropriation to the Department of Commerce intact. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 522(3)(y).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0"><TextRun fontWeight="bold">Section 602(105), page 793, University of Washington, Ranked Choice Voting Study</TextRun></P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">This section requires the University of Washington Evans School of Public Policy and Governance to conduct a study on ranked choice voting and to provide guidance for implementation by local jurisdictions by June 1, 2025. In addition to inadequate funding, not enough time is provided for local elections staff, who may be tasked as subject matter experts, to be able to properly dedicate the time that this comprehensive study would require, especially in a presidential election year. For this reason, I have vetoed Section 602(105).</P>
<P prePadding="halfline" indent="0">The following sections provide funding to agencies to implement bills which did not pass the Legislature. Because the funding has lapsed, I have vetoed Section 118(3), Section 202(33), Section 302(70), Section 502(4), and Section 507(11).</P>
